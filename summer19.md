### S tier - Best 10/10

### A tier - Really good 8-9/10
1. Chernonyl - 8/10. Not a movie but deserves an honorable mention because it's the best thing I watched this summer.
1. Spiderman: Far From Home - 7.5/10. This movie far exceeded my expectations and part of the reason for the high rating is because the theater made the experience much better. I liked the meta comments about super heros, the world building of the post Iron Man death world. The fight sequence that ends with Spiderman being hit by the train was one of the coolest I've seen, I love when everything goes quiet. In general, Spiderman has to be my favorite action movie franchise. I like that Spiderman fights with some strategy since he is not the strongest being.

### C tier - OK Movies 5-7/10
There were a lot of 7's this summer. These movies were good, enjoyable, but not amazing.

1. The Tree of Life - 7.1/10. Watched about half of this movie with Horace before we went to sleep. I guess it's an ambitious film, but honestly it's really confusing. The premise is simple enough - an adult reflecting on his memories to figure out why he is who he is. I didn't understand that until reading explainations of the film. A lot of confusing sequences (the Big Bang up until dinosaurs etc.) Ending of the movie was meh. Brad Pitt did a nice job as a stern father and they built up his character well. I did like how they depicted the life of a surburban kid's upbringing, it does remind me of mine, and I recognize that that is hard to do.
1. Toy Story 4 - 7/10. I watched the first Toy Story, and probably the 2nd and 3rd although I don't remember. It was okay. I made a joke about organ harvesting when Woody went into that creepy shop, and it turned out that's actually what happened. I don't like how in kids movies, the bad guy turns good. Bo Peep is so awesome. I love competence.
1. Annie Hall - 7/10. I saw this the first time after watching two other movies that day. Horace and I ended up stopping halfway. I was inspired to watch this movie because I saw a video about 500 Days of Summer and this movie was mentioned as the rom-com of its generation. Through that lense, the movie was a lot more interesting. I watched this at 1.5x. Overall, a bit more appreciation for the film but nothing spectacular.
1. Aladdin - 7/10. Exceeded my expectations. I liked the songs (Speechless was hilarious in the movie but I like the song, Prince Ali, Friend Like Me). The plot in the beginning with the lamp was rushed.
1. Ghost in the Shell - 7/10. I watched this movie sped up as well. I didn't completely understand the politics going on between the different sectors and that might be because of the speed. I thought there were some interesting philosophical questions.
1. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - 7/10. So much anticipation for this movie but the plot moved so slowly. Margot Robbie barely did anything and had almost no dialogue. Leaving the theater, my rating was a lot lower, but after looking at the reviews, I understood the movie better: the Manson family + murders, Margot Robbie had a great performance. The ending was pretty fun to watch and Brad Pitt's character was soooo badass.

### F tier - did not enjoy <4/10
1. The Lion King - 4/10. I'm not a huge fan of this movie in the first place and the live action remake was even worse. The characters don't show any emotion through their faces and animals talking in english is weirder when they look realistic. Kid Simba was cocky and annoying. Adolescent Simba was totally nihilistic and still annoying. The animation was pretty cool, looked like animal planet. Yeah, I also just find the story stupid, not really inspiring.
