## Zbobo :) Winter '18

1. Avengers, Infinity War - 7/10 Exactly the movie I expected. Was much more enjoyable watching on Netflix because I could skip through scenes that I found boring. Otherwise, this would be a 5/10
1. The Lobster - 8.5/10 Very interesting idea, dialogue was super unsettling. Great directing to make such a creepy tone. A surprisingly good movie.
1. Ghost in the Shell - ?/10 Too much time has passed since watching the film so I don't have a rating. I was a little confused with the film though. Probably because I watched at at 1.5x or 2x. Might deserve a rewatch.
