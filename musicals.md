## Zaibo's Musical Rankings

My rating for a musical changes over the weeks after seeing the musical live. Since I haven't seen a musical live, my memory of musicals is somewhat distorted because the "extras" footage I see on youtube such as backstage videos are a different cast.

### 1. Jesus Chris Superstar
- Watched with Horace at BroadwaySF on 11/2
- This affirms that the best way to see a musical is to see in person, watch the proshot and listen to the soundtrack, and finally see it again. This is the first time I've gone to a musical and knew the songs inside and out. I felt like I could sing along with the entire show.
- It's great to hear the instruments live. They did a great job of emulating a full set of string instruments - I'm always surprised at how small yet effective a pit orchestra can be. Overall, the musicians were great - there was a crazy sax(?) solo which was obstructed from view. The electric guitar was also super cool and I'm happy that the the musicians are featured center stage.
- The ensemble was the MVP. It was a lot bigger than I expected; in general, the cast was much bigger than most of the other musicals I've been to. There's something special about having 10-20 people sing the chorus. The dancing overall was also really entertaining.
- Judas was pretty disappointing. He mic was too quiet and often times, the instrumentation covered the vocals. Coming in, I was most looking forward to Judas, but I found myself enjoying the Jesus/Mary songs a LOT more.
- I was very impressed with Jesus. I enjoyed Gethesmane immensely and that was definitely the highlight of the show for me.
- I enjoyed Mary in the musical much more than in the move. I thought the actor player her did a really great job. I didn't realize Mary had 4 songs, they weren't memorable in the movie version.

### 1. Beetlejuice
- Watched with Katie at the Marquis Theatre on 06/30/22
- By the first half of Act I, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this musical at all. I was bored of all the exposition in the first few songs - "Ready Set, Not Yet", "Dead Mom", "Fright of Their Lives". The musical got a lot better once Lydia meets Beetlejuice. That's the character duo that we really want to see.
- The star of the show, of course, is Alex Brightman as Beetlejuice. It goes without saying but he killed it. Truly an iconic performance.
- Lydia was pretty good. Most of her solos are the type where it's kinda hard to hear all the lyrics live. I like "Dead Mom" a lot more now that I have heard the song clearly. This actress looked a lot younger than the orignal cast (Sophia Anne Caruso) which I saw youtube videos of.
- I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnLBSulmiW0) a lot. It would have been absolutely crazy to see this on opening day. While watching the musical, it felt like a lot of the audience had already see it and were rewatching. There were many moments (like in the video where Beetlejuice appears) which I wouldn't expect clapping for unless you know the actor or the character. It's like the line "My name is Alexander Hamilton" - if Lin gave a performance today, there would be tons of applause on that line. I totally get it though - if I saw Beetlejuice again, I would cheer in those places. I do wonder how many people in the crowd have seen the musical.
- In the next few days after watching it live, I've been watching youtube vids related to the musical. It's made better by the fact that Alex Brightman was the Beetlejuice that we saw as well. I really enjoy the (shitty) recordings that people post so I can relive my experience, but I hate the people that pull out their phones to record during the show. I just really wish proshots were more commonly released.
- The production and set design were amazing. This is by far the best produced musical I have ever (and probably will ever) see. It's incredible how much a live performance could 
_feel_ like an animated cartoon. All the goofy actions and synced up with the cartoon sfx. Beetlejuice does a lot of slight of hand tricks which are a nice touch. I haven't seen a magic show live (mostly videos) and those kind of things happen so fast that unless you know what you're looking for, it looks super legit. The lights and projections are awesome. All the props that come from the pit are crazy. The giant snake is surprisingly plot-relevant. The ensemble has so many different costumes. 
- Until listening to the recording, I didn't get that the funeral we saw at the beginning was the mother. I thought it was Beetlejuice lol. Similarly, I only 'got' the theme of "being invisible" from the recording.

### 1. Hadestown
- Watched with Horace, Qian and Katie at the Orpheum Theatre on 06/11/22
- This preceded a musical dry spell of a few months. I absolutely LOVED the opening act. What a mood-setter! I was smiling from ear to ear because I knew I was in for a treat.
- I enjoyed all of the main cast performances except for Eurydice. It felt similar to JCS where Judas was worse than the rest of the cast. The most jarring part was her movement. The actor just moved her arms awkwardly and once I noticed it, I couldn't unsee. 
- I wasn't a huge fan of Orpheus until the second half.
- Persephone had the most standout performance followed by Hermes. I really wished there were more Persephone songs. I thought the Hermes we saw was better than the Hermes from the original cast. I love his narration parts.
- I love that the pit is on stage and the musical actually incorporates the instrumentalists. This is in contrast to Bettlejuice and Book of Mormon where they are actually in a pit. I appreciate the music a lot more when I see the musician playing it. I think that's also why I enjoyed JCS so much live (it opens with an electric guitar solo). I also really enjoyed seeing the fates play instruments too. The violin fate was legit, in one song, she had the more complex violin part. I love the fourth wall break in "Lady of the Underground" where Persephone introduces the pit! I really hope that the style of putting the pit on stage becomes more mainstream. 
- The recording hits different and the instrumentals are a big part of it. After leaving the theater, we started listening to the recording and it just felt flat. The trombone is just louder and more powerful live and that makes a huge difference. Another cute detail in the live performance is how long Hermes stretches out the last note in Road to Hell. He keeps it going longer than however long you think it's going to go.
- I really liked the plot, which is a rare compliment for me to give. Up until the end, I really wasn't sure how things were going to turn out? Maybe in this rendition, Orpheus actually escapes? Nope! The moment where Orpheus looked back really caught me off guard. The musical quickly shuts that down with the message that it's a timeless tale that we want to see again and again, even if we know how it ends. Hermes gave a fantastic performance of the Road to Hell (Reprise). Really emotional moment.
- The tall fate with the tamboruine was a great cast. She looked exactly like how I'd expect a fate to look.
- I liked the plot point that Hades is moved by Orpheus' song, but he has trouble deciding how to proceed. It appears that this part deviates from the original myth where Persephone decides they can go. 
- We had front row seats, but it's clear that a few rows back would have been much better. We were getting seriously fogged up and subsequently blinded by the lights. In "Wait for Me", we were looking up at the lamps so we somewhat missed out on the choreography. This show would have been better to see on the mezz.

### 1. Book of Mormon
- Watched with Jenny on Broadway, 06/17 (my first live musical!)
- Highest out of theater rating. In fact, I was so satisfied with this that I wanted to see another musical in the week I was in New York.
- Conversely, the soundtrack didn't have as much replayability as any of the other musicals.
- "Hello" was so cool to see live where they manipulate the lights. Had that song stuck in my mind for the rest of the night.
- Really crude humor ("I will give you AIDS")
- The girl sang amazingly. I don't remember her name because Elder Price always said her name wrong.
- Spooky Mormon Hell Dream was an amazing performance. Loved how the devil was playing guitar. Awesome choreagraphy.
- Elder Cunningham actor was hilarious. Such a good character.

### 1. Hamilton
- Watched with Katy, Qian, Horace in SF, 08/19
- First surprise was that there are almost no spoken parts. Everything is a song. That was a bit exhausting. It's good for post-musical experience because I can essentially listen to the entire thing over again, but I never felt like I had a break where I could digest the music.
- I was a little disappointed leaving the theater. I thought Hamilton was overhyped.
- Aaron Burr's head was so shiny. At one point, it was completely blue because of the light it reflected.
- I had no idea who Theodosia was when listening to the soundtrack post-musical.
- Act 1 was significantly better than Act 2. Revolution and war make a much more exciting plot. I was a lot less invested into Act 2. The cabinet battles were cool though.
- All the King George songs are great and hilarious live. Loved the line "I'm so blue"
- Yorktown was a memorable performance. I vividly remember the chairs being lifted upside down.
- Hamilton does an amazing job of weaving different song themes together. The intro to "Alexander Hamilton" is used in many different songs. "Helpless" has a cameo in "Satisfied". Lots of reprises. I'm sure there are a lot of cool details in the choreography between "Helpless" and "Satisfied"
- Satisfied had great choreagraphy. The turn tables were a great effect, allow people to walk fast or walk in place.

### 1. Waitress
- Watched with Katie on Broadway

### 1. Book of Mormon (rewatch)
- Watched with Katie at the Eugene O'neill Theatre on 07/3/22
- I expected to really enjoy rewatching this because of how much I enjoyed seeing JCS live, but this missed the mark. There wasn't anything that was particularly disappointing though. Maybe there are diminishing returns on rewatching a comedy. My first watching was memorable because it was my first musical and I was surprised at how raunchy the humor would be. The second time around, the "Fuck you god", "shit go in the water", "I have maggots in my scrotum" isn't nearly as funny because I've heard it hundreds of times on recording.
With that in mind, I would still be interested in rewatching Hadestown, Beetlejuice and JCS if the opportunity came.
- There's a lot of stuff I may be misremembering about the first show I watched so take the comparisons with a grain of salt
- I didn't like the exposition on the church given at the beginning of the acts. In particular, starting with a bit of history as opposed to "Hello" was really disappointing for me. I really wanted to relive the scene where it's all dark and these random mormon guys start popping off. Because the little history lesson transitions to "Hello", you end up seeing them all, just in the shadows. (see my review of the first watch "they manipulate the lights")
- Elder Cunningham had a great performance (as always). I liked this one more than the previous. I think he as wearing a fat suit?
- The pink vests in 'turn it off' were great. I thought that this was a new addition to the 2022 production, but it appears not.
- Holistically, the set design looked a lot better than I remember it. For example, the mormon boys have these boy bands white t's that they pull out specifically for Man Up and never again. Compare this to something like hades town, where the ensemble only has two constumes and the rest of the cast (bar Persephone) basically wears the some costume for the entire musical. Did they have the monster + darth vader costumes? Probably and I forgot about it.
- There's a guitar solo in "Spooky Mormon Hell Dream" that I was looking forward which I somehow missed! I saw them pass the guitar to the devil so it's not like I didn't notice it, but I just didn't hear it :(
- Our seats were the second orchestra row. The downside was that since it was so close to the stage, it would be really bright which broken the immersion of the theater. I could see all the people around me.

### 1. Wicked
- Watched with Aaron, Jenny, Isak, Lauren on Broadway, 06/19
- I came late and missed the first song, this was fairly important for the plot and confused me for a good part of the musical (who is the father??)
- After the musical, I was really disappointed. Definitely the worst out-of-theater rating. After listening to the soundtrack more, my rating has gone up.
- Lauren said that Wicked has some of the most difficult songs. I see that now.
- Would love to see Popular, Defying Gravity, For Good again.

### 1. Dear Evan Hansen

- Watched this on Broadway with Jenny, 08/19.
- The projections were cool, and added to the experience. I found myself looking at them even during the songs.
- I realized after watching this that the costumes are important to be. I don't like how this musical was so normal (in a highschool setting). The cast was also tiny and there weren't too many big dance numbers (or much dancing at all).
- The plot was juvenille, felt like it came out of a Disney Channel show. Protagonist lies and ends up having to tell more lies to cover up the original. Eventually, he gets caught in his lies and in this case, doesn't really face any consequences.
- Like Jenny said, the message, "you are not alone" is really shoved down your throat.
- This was also the first musical where mistakes from the cast took me out of the show. "Good For You" has really weird timing and when I was watching live, I thought the music was out of sync.
- Evan is an awkward boy and that inflection is also in his songs. I get the idea, but it just sounds like he's singing poorly.
- Requiem is my favorite song to listen to now; Sincerely, Me was my favorite to see live, alsolutely hilarious.
- I love when musicals can weave together different themes over the course of the music. Wicked does this with the "I'm limited" theme, Hamilton does this on another level. This musical doesn't do it at all.
