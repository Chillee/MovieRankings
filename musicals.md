## Zaibo's Musical Rankings

My rating for a musical changes over the weeks after seeing the musical live. Since I haven't seen a musical live, my memory of musicals is somewhat distorted because the "extras" footage I see on youtube such as backstage videos are a different cast.

### 1. Jesus Chris Superstar
- Watched with Horace at BroadwaySF on 11/2
- This affirms that the best way to see a musical is to see in person, watch the proshot and listen to the soundtrack, and finally see it again. This is the first time I've gone to a musical and knew the songs inside and out. I felt like I could sing along with the entire show.
- It's great to hear the instruments live. They did a great job of emulating a full set of string instruments - I'm always surprised at how small yet effective a pit orchestra can be. Overall, the musicians were great - there was a crazy sax(?) solo which was obstructed from view. The electric guitar was also super cool and I'm happy that the the musicians are featured center stage.
- The ensemble was the MVP. It was a lot bigger than I expected; in general, the cast was much bigger than most of the other musicals I've been to. There's something special about having 10-20 people sing the chorus. The dancing overall was also really entertaining.
- Judas was pretty disappointing. He mic was too quiet and often times, the instrumentation covered the vocals. Coming in, I was most looking forward to Judas, but I found myself enjoying the Jesus/Mary songs a LOT more.
- I was very impressed with Jesus. I enjoyed Gethesmane immensely and that was definitely the highlight of the show for me.
- I enjoyed Mary in the musical much more than in the move. I thought the actor player her did a really great job. I didn't realize Mary had 4 songs, they weren't memorable in the movie version.

### 1. Book of Mormon
- Watched with Jenny on Broadway, 06/17
- Highest out of theater rating. In fact, I was so satisfied with this that I wanted to see another musical in the week I was in New York.
- Conversely, the soundtrack didn't have as much replayability as any of the other musicals.
- "Hello" was so cool to see live where they manipulate the lights. Had that song stuck in my mind for the rest of the night.
- Really crude humor ("I will give you AIDS")
- The girl sang amazingly. I don't remember her name because Elder Price always said her name wrong.
- Spooky Mormon Hell Dream was an amazing performance. Loved how the devil was playing guitar. Awesome choreagraphy.
- Elder Cunningham actor was hilarious. Such a good character.

### 2. Hamilton
- Watched with Katy, Qian, Horace in SF, 08/19
- First surprise was that there are almost no spoken parts. Everything is a song. That was a bit exhausting. It's good for post-musical experience because I can essentially listen to the entire thing over again, but I never felt like I had a break where I could digest the music.
- I was a little disappointed leaving the theater. I thought Hamilton was overhyped.
- Aaron Burr's head was so shiny. At one point, it was completely blue because of the light it reflected.
- I had no idea who Theodosia was when listening to the soundtrack post-musical.
- Act 1 was significantly better than Act 2. Revolution and war make a much more exciting plot. I was a lot less invested into Act 2. The cabinet battles were cool though.
- All the King George songs are great and hilarious live. Loved the line "I'm so blue"
- Yorktown was a memorable performance. I vividly remember the chairs being lifted upside down.
- Hamilton does an amazing job of weaving different song themes together. The intro to "Alexander Hamilton" is used in many different songs. "Helpless" has a cameo in "Satisfied". Lots of reprises. I'm sure there are a lot of cool details in the choreography between "Helpless" and "Satisfied"
- Satisfied had great choreagraphy. The turn tables were a great effect, allow people to walk fast or walk in place.

### 3. Wicked
- Watched with Aaron, Jenny, Isak, Lauren on Broadway, 06/19
- I came late and missed the first song, this was fairly important for the plot and confused me for a good part of the musical (who is the father??)
- After the musical, I was really disappointed. Definitely the worst out-of-theater rating. After listening to the soundtrack more, my rating has gone up.
- Lauren said that Wicked has some of the most difficult songs. I see that now.
- Would love to see Popular, Defying Gravity, For Good again.

### 4. Dear Evan Hansen

- Watched this on Broadway with Jenny, 08/19.
- The projections were cool, and added to the experience. I found myself looking at them even during the songs.
- I realized after watching this that the costumes are important to be. I don't like how this musical was so normal (in a highschool setting). The cast was also tiny and there weren't too many big dance numbers (or much dancing at all).
- The plot was juvenille, felt like it came out of a Disney Channel show. Protagonist lies and ends up having to tell more lies to cover up the original. Eventually, he gets caught in his lies and in this case, doesn't really face any consequences.
- Like Jenny said, the message, "you are not alone" is really shoved down your throat.
- This was also the first musical where mistakes from the cast took me out of the show. "Good For You" has really weird timing and when I was watching live, I thought the music was out of sync.
- Evan is an awkward boy and that inflection is also in his songs. I get the idea, but it just sounds like he's singing poorly.
- Requiem is my favorite song to listen to now; Sincerely, Me was my favorite to see live, alsolutely hilarious.
- I love when musicals can weave together different themes over the course of the music. Wicked does this with the "I'm limited" theme, Hamilton does this on another level. This musical doesn't do it at all.
