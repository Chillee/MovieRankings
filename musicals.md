## Zaibo's Musical Rankings

My rating for a musical changes over the weeks after seeing the musical live. Since I haven't seen a musical live, my memory of musicals is somewhat distorted because the "extras" footage I see on youtube such as backstage videos are a different cast.

### 1. Jesus Chris Superstar
- Watched with Horace at BroadwaySF on 11/2
- This affirms that the best way to see a musical is to see in person, watch the proshot and listen to the soundtrack, and finally see it again. This is the first time I've gone to a musical and knew the songs inside and out. I felt like I could sing along with the entire show.
- It's great to hear the instruments live. They did a great job of emulating a full set of string instruments - I'm always surprised at how small yet effective a pit orchestra can be. Overall, the musicians were great - there was a crazy sax(?) solo which was obstructed from view. The electric guitar was also super cool and I'm happy that the the musicians are featured center stage.
- The ensemble was the MVP. It was a lot bigger than I expected; in general, the cast was much bigger than most of the other musicals I've been to. There's something special about having 10-20 people sing the chorus. The dancing overall was also really entertaining.
- Judas was pretty disappointing. He mic was too quiet and often times, the instrumentation covered the vocals. Coming in, I was most looking forward to Judas, but I found myself enjoying the Jesus/Mary songs a LOT more.
- I was very impressed with Jesus. I enjoyed Gethesmane immensely and that was definitely the highlight of the show for me.
- I enjoyed Mary in the musical much more than in the move. I thought the actor player her did a really great job. I didn't realize Mary had 4 songs, they weren't memorable in the movie version.

### 1. Beetlejuice
- Watched with Katie at the Marquis Theatre on 06/30/22
- By the first half of Act I, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this musical at all. I was bored of all the exposition in the first few songs - "Ready Set, Not Yet", "Dead Mom", "Fright of Their Lives". The musical got a lot better once Lydia meets Beetlejuice. That's the character duo that we really want to see.
- The star of the show, of course, is Alex Brightman as Beetlejuice. It goes without saying but he killed it. Truly an iconic performance.
- Lydia was pretty good. Most of her solos are the type where it's kinda hard to hear all the lyrics live. I like "Dead Mom" a lot more now that I have heard the song clearly. This actress looked a lot younger than the orignal cast (Sophia Anne Caruso) which I saw youtube videos of.
- I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnLBSulmiW0) a lot. It would have been absolutely crazy to see this on opening day. While watching the musical, it felt like a lot of the audience had already see it and were rewatching. There were many moments (like in the video where Beetlejuice appears) which I wouldn't expect clapping for unless you know the actor or the character. It's like the line "My name is Alexander Hamilton" - if Lin gave a performance today, there would be tons of applause on that line. I totally get it though - if I saw Beetlejuice again, I would cheer in those places. I do wonder how many people in the crowd have seen the musical.
- In the next few days after watching it live, I've been watching youtube vids related to the musical. It's made better by the fact that Alex Brightman was the Beetlejuice that we saw as well. I really enjoy the (shitty) recordings that people post so I can relive my experience, but I hate the people that pull out their phones to record during the show. I just really wish proshots were more commonly released.
- The production and set design were amazing. This is by far the best produced musical I have ever (and probably will ever) see. It's incredible how much a live performance could 
_feel_ like an animated cartoon. All the goofy actions and synced up with the cartoon sfx. Beetlejuice does a lot of slight of hand tricks which are a nice touch. I haven't seen a magic show live (mostly videos) and those kind of things happen so fast that unless you know what you're looking for, it looks super legit. The lights and projections are awesome. All the props that come from the pit are crazy. The giant snake is surprisingly plot-relevant. The ensemble has so many different costumes. 
- Until listening to the recording, I didn't get that the funeral we saw at the beginning was the mother. I thought it was Beetlejuice lol. Similarly, I only 'got' the theme of "being invisible" from the recording.

### 1. Phantom of the Opera
- Watched with Katie on 09/27/22 (West End)
- This was the third music we watched over the weekend. I find myself enjoying Drama/Tragedy a lot more than Comedy. I look forward to seeing this show again (unlike &Juliet, Book of Mormon etc.)
- I always had the perception that PotO was a scuffed musical because the tickets were so cheap. Now I see why this is such a classic.
- I watched about 40 minutes of the pro shot a few months earlier but didn't enjoy it that much so I stopped watching midway. That said, I was super excited to see it live and I knew that I would really enjoy it.
- The opening sequence is probably my favorite of all musicals. It's just so hype to see the chandellier pop and rise up. 
- There were several songs that were hard to understand. In general, any song that had more than one person singing at once (even the trio between Christine, Christian and Phantom). Most of the opera sung parts were also hard to understand.
- There's quite a few plot details which I still don't understand. Why is Phantom friends with the dance instructor? Why does she tell the truth about who the Phantom is? Why does Christine's father describe an Angel of Music? Is it just suppose to be a coincidence that the Phantom falls in love with a girl who is particularly suseptible to being manipulated? Or is there some kind of past relationship between Christine's father and the Phantom? I also had a hard time picturing the actual theater.. How is there a lake in the theater? Maybe this is actually the sewers? For a movie, these details would be more important to me, but I'm willing to let them pass since it's a musical. I'm guessing it's explained in the original source material.
- I was on the edge of my seat for the last third of the musical. Part of this was because I didn't know how things would end. 
- The titular song is a banger. I'm sure I'll appreciate the other songs more as I listen to the album. I'll note that the youtube video for PotO was matched the live version pretty closely.
- The props were super cool. I liked Phantom's fire gun. His mysterious disappearance at the end was a nice surprise.
- I really enjoyed seeing "Think of Me" where we transition from audition to performance. The transition feels like a scene out of a movie so it's cool to see it pulled off live.
- For the first time, we waited at the stage door afterwards to see the cast leave. Notably, we saw Phantom and Christine's friend leave. It was interesting seeing them in normal clothes (Phantom was a biker). Christine's friend was very attractive.

### 1. Hadestown
- Watched with Horace, Qian and Katie at the Orpheum Theatre on 06/11/22
- This preceded a musical dry spell of a few months. I absolutely LOVED the opening act. What a mood-setter! I was smiling from ear to ear because I knew I was in for a treat.
- I enjoyed all of the main cast performances except for Eurydice. It felt similar to JCS where Judas was worse than the rest of the cast. The most jarring part was her movement. The actor just moved her arms awkwardly and once I noticed it, I couldn't unsee. 
- I wasn't a huge fan of Orpheus until the second half.
- Persephone had the most standout performance followed by Hermes. I really wished there were more Persephone songs. I thought the Hermes we saw was better than the Hermes from the original cast. I love his narration parts.
- I love that the pit is on stage and the musical actually incorporates the instrumentalists. This is in contrast to Bettlejuice and Book of Mormon where they are actually in a pit. I appreciate the music a lot more when I see the musician playing it. I think that's also why I enjoyed JCS so much live (it opens with an electric guitar solo). I also really enjoyed seeing the fates play instruments too. The violin fate was legit, in one song, she had the more complex violin part. I love the fourth wall break in "Lady of the Underground" where Persephone introduces the pit! I really hope that the style of putting the pit on stage becomes more mainstream. 
- The recording hits different and the instrumentals are a big part of it. After leaving the theater, we started listening to the recording and it just felt flat. The trombone is just louder and more powerful live and that makes a huge difference. Another cute detail in the live performance is how long Hermes stretches out the last note in Road to Hell. He keeps it going longer than however long you think it's going to go.
- I really liked the plot, which is a rare compliment for me to give. Up until the end, I really wasn't sure how things were going to turn out? Maybe in this rendition, Orpheus actually escapes? Nope! The moment where Orpheus looked back really caught me off guard. The musical quickly shuts that down with the message that it's a timeless tale that we want to see again and again, even if we know how it ends. Hermes gave a fantastic performance of the Road to Hell (Reprise). Really emotional moment.
- The tall fate with the tamboruine was a great cast. She looked exactly like how I'd expect a fate to look.
- I liked the plot point that Hades is moved by Orpheus' song, but he has trouble deciding how to proceed. It appears that this part deviates from the original myth where Persephone decides they can go. 
- We had front row seats, but it's clear that a few rows back would have been much better. We were getting seriously fogged up and subsequently blinded by the lights. In "Wait for Me", we were looking up at the lamps so we somewhat missed out on the choreography. This show would have been better to see on the mezz.

### 1. Les Miserables
- Watched With Katie 09/22 (West End)
- We watched the movie version over a year ago and I was super excited to see it live (just like with JCS). Overall, I enjoyed the act 1 much more than act 2. If act 2 was as good as act 1, then this would probably be my favorite musical. Almost all the good songs are in the first act.
- It's interesting that `I Dreamed a Dream` happens so earlier on. In my memory of the movie, it was one of the major songs, but it's actually the third song in the musical.
- Cosett's child actor was good but didn't have a much part. The boy child actor had a larger role but wasn't as good.
- I couldn't hear the lyrics of Master of the House that well.
- I really didn't like the barricade parts. This is one of those scenes that's much harder to do on a stage than in a movie. We see the defending side of the barricade and the French army is left to our imagination. The gunshots are just stage lights and a bunch of loud noises. This was the biggest detractor of the musical. 
- I remember Javert's suicide differently because I listen to the rendition of `Stars` a lot and I think the concert bundles the song with the suicide even though they happen far apart. I wasn't sure how we would see it live but I loved it! He is on a short railing but gets pulled up. Then the lights make it look like he's falling. Really well done!
- Unlike the movie, the opening number doesn't really give a sense for how strong JVJ is. It's then referenced later on when he lifts the wheelbarrow which is a bit weird.

### 1. Book of Mormon
- Watched with Jenny on Broadway, 06/17 (my first live musical!)
- Highest out of theater rating. In fact, I was so satisfied with this that I wanted to see another musical in the week I was in New York.
- Conversely, the soundtrack didn't have as much replayability as any of the other musicals.
- "Hello" was so cool to see live where they manipulate the lights. Had that song stuck in my mind for the rest of the night.
- Really crude humor ("I will give you AIDS")
- The girl sang amazingly. I don't remember her name because Elder Price always said her name wrong.
- Spooky Mormon Hell Dream was an amazing performance. Loved how the devil was playing guitar. Awesome choreagraphy.
- Elder Cunningham actor was hilarious. Such a good character.

### 1. Hamilton
- Watched with Katy, Qian, Horace in SF, 08/19
- First surprise was that there are almost no spoken parts. Everything is a song. That was a bit exhausting. It's good for post-musical experience because I can essentially listen to the entire thing over again, but I never felt like I had a break where I could digest the music.
- I was a little disappointed leaving the theater. I thought Hamilton was overhyped.
- Aaron Burr's head was so shiny. At one point, it was completely blue because of the light it reflected.
- I had no idea who Theodosia was when listening to the soundtrack post-musical.
- Act 1 was significantly better than Act 2. Revolution and war make a much more exciting plot. I was a lot less invested into Act 2. The cabinet battles were cool though.
- All the King George songs are great and hilarious live. Loved the line "I'm so blue"
- Yorktown was a memorable performance. I vividly remember the chairs being lifted upside down.
- Hamilton does an amazing job of weaving different song themes together. The intro to "Alexander Hamilton" is used in many different songs. "Helpless" has a cameo in "Satisfied". Lots of reprises. I'm sure there are a lot of cool details in the choreography between "Helpless" and "Satisfied"
- Satisfied had great choreagraphy. The turn tables were a great effect, allow people to walk fast or walk in place.

### 1. Waitress
- Watched with Katie on Broadway

### 1. Moulin Rogue
- Watched with Horace, Qian, Katie 10/02/22 (BroadwaySF)
- This was the worst opening that I've ever watched. Things got a lot better and I find the second act to be much better than the first. In general, any number which had a chorus singing was loud and a bit obnoxious. I had no idea what was going on in the opening number and it set my expectations for the musical very low. I really did not enjoy any song that didn't move the plot forward. 
- Once we started learning about the plot and the main characters, I found myself enjoying things a lot more. 
- There were some interesting lighting effects. Of note, I've never seen the one where they alternate between lights from the left and right so you see one side and then the shadow. That was pretty cool.
- I yearned for hearing a cover of Kanye in Diamonds of Forever but instead we got the original song. I was just waiting for the beat to drop. That would have been a highlight.
- The medleys were an interesting twist on the jukebox musical, but it was hard for me to shake off the nostalgia of 2010's youtube pop song medley's. The felt a bit dated to me.
- Some lyrics feel super out of place. For example, "like the fourth of july" in firework when we're in France. Maybe this takes place after the American revolution but it's still kinda weird.
- The male lead was very very good, broadway material. The female lead... I couldn't tell how good she was but her mic was set up so she would peak on the loud parts and that ruined her songs for me. Particularly when the two of them have duets and her voice overshadows the guy.
- The audience laughed whenever a familiar tune started (which was often). I found this off putting because it just wasn't that funny to me. 
- Roxanne was my favorite song because of the beautiful violin solo. I really wish they incorporate some melodies from Carmen Fantasy... it would just fit so perfectly. We see on stage a women in a red dress. The themes fit with Carmen and we are listening to a violin solo. Not to mention, they include Carmen in other parts of the musical. Oh well... I loved listening to it.
- I got much more into the music in the second act. I think it helped to have my expectations set of what kind of music we would be hearing.
- I quite liked the plot (which is rare for me to say). Why are there so many stories of men falling in love with prostitutes?

### 1. &Juliet
- Watched with Katie 09/22 (West End)
- Besides the Mamma Mia movie, this was my first jukebox musical. I think the musical itself is entertaining, but the reason I enjoy musicals is listening to the soundtrack afterwards. When I see a cover of a pop song, it's hard for to not imagine 2010's youtube where most of the musicals were cover artists. Besides that, comedies just don't have the same lasting power as dramas. I want to see Hadestown again and again. I'm fine with seeing &Juliet once in my live. I'm not interested in another performers rendition of pop songs. 
- I find that jukebox musicals are a bit cheesy since they have to incorporate some weird lyrics that are part of the original song. They are played off as jokes. Or when two characters have a conversation in song that originally was written for one singer.
- All that said, I really liked the cover of Blow. That's one of the only songs I remember. 
- This feels like the first "modern" musical that I've watched. The characters are woke, there's non-binary characters that have legit storylines. It's very much focused on female empowerment and rewriting history. Feels like it was writing for my generation. I knew every single song (by lyric).
- I enjoyed Anne's character and performance the most. She reminds me of Persephone. The other characters were all decent but not particularly memorable.
- The production was on the level of Beetlejuice, except a completely different aesthetic. I enjoyed all the lighting and vfx.
- Romeo coming back in act 2 was pretty funny. 

### 1. Book of Mormon (rewatch)
- Watched with Katie at the Eugene O'neill Theatre on 07/3/22
- I expected to really enjoy rewatching this because of how much I enjoyed seeing JCS live, but this missed the mark. There wasn't anything that was particularly disappointing though. Maybe there are diminishing returns on rewatching a comedy. My first watching was memorable because it was my first musical and I was surprised at how raunchy the humor would be. The second time around, the "Fuck you god", "shit go in the water", "I have maggots in my scrotum" isn't nearly as funny because I've heard it hundreds of times on recording.
With that in mind, I would still be interested in rewatching Hadestown, Beetlejuice and JCS if the opportunity came.
- There's a lot of stuff I may be misremembering about the first show I watched so take the comparisons with a grain of salt
- I didn't like the exposition on the church given at the beginning of the acts. In particular, starting with a bit of history as opposed to "Hello" was really disappointing for me. I really wanted to relive the scene where it's all dark and these random mormon guys start popping off. Because the little history lesson transitions to "Hello", you end up seeing them all, just in the shadows. (see my review of the first watch "they manipulate the lights")
- Elder Cunningham had a great performance (as always). I liked this one more than the previous. I think he as wearing a fat suit?
- The pink vests in 'turn it off' were great. I thought that this was a new addition to the 2022 production, but it appears not.
- Holistically, the set design looked a lot better than I remember it. For example, the mormon boys have these boy bands white t's that they pull out specifically for Man Up and never again. Compare this to something like hades town, where the ensemble only has two constumes and the rest of the cast (bar Persephone) basically wears the some costume for the entire musical. Did they have the monster + darth vader costumes? Probably and I forgot about it.
- There's a guitar solo in "Spooky Mormon Hell Dream" that I was looking forward which I somehow missed! I saw them pass the guitar to the devil so it's not like I didn't notice it, but I just didn't hear it :(
- Our seats were the second orchestra row. The downside was that since it was so close to the stage, it would be really bright which broken the immersion of the theater. I could see all the people around me.

### 1. Wicked
- Watched with Aaron, Jenny, Isak, Lauren on Broadway, 06/19
- I came late and missed the first song, this was fairly important for the plot and confused me for a good part of the musical (who is the father??)
- After the musical, I was really disappointed. Definitely the worst out-of-theater rating. After listening to the soundtrack more, my rating has gone up.
- Lauren said that Wicked has some of the most difficult songs. I see that now.
- Would love to see Popular, Defying Gravity, For Good again.

### 1. Dear Evan Hansen

- Watched this on Broadway with Jenny, 08/19.
- The projections were cool, and added to the experience. I found myself looking at them even during the songs.
- I realized after watching this that the costumes are important to be. I don't like how this musical was so normal (in a highschool setting). The cast was also tiny and there weren't too many big dance numbers (or much dancing at all).
- The plot was juvenille, felt like it came out of a Disney Channel show. Protagonist lies and ends up having to tell more lies to cover up the original. Eventually, he gets caught in his lies and in this case, doesn't really face any consequences.
- Like Jenny said, the message, "you are not alone" is really shoved down your throat.
- This was also the first musical where mistakes from the cast took me out of the show. "Good For You" has really weird timing and when I was watching live, I thought the music was out of sync.
- Evan is an awkward boy and that inflection is also in his songs. I get the idea, but it just sounds like he's singing poorly.
- Requiem is my favorite song to listen to now; Sincerely, Me was my favorite to see live, alsolutely hilarious.
- I love when musicals can weave together different themes over the course of the music. Wicked does this with the "I'm limited" theme, Hamilton does this on another level. This musical doesn't do it at all.
