## Horace
5/5 (Willing to rewatch at any time with anybody)
----------------
1. **Parasite**
1. **Silence of the Lambs**
1. **When Harry Met Sally**
1. **Royal Tenenbaums**
1. **Children of Men**
1. **Drive**
1. **The Fighter**
1. **The Good the Bad and the Ugly (rewatch)**
1. **In Bruges**
1. **Memento**: My enjoyment of the movie went like this. "The premise is interesting, but I don't think it'll stand up to a whole movie. Hence why I haven't watched this movie yet" -> "Huh, I guess the premise leads to some interesting narrative moments + simulates the life of the protagonist. Knowing the answer to a whodunnit can be played around with interesting ways" -> "The premise leads to some interesting moments, but over the course of the whole movie, it ruins the suspense too much and makes the movie less enjoyable" -> "Wait......." -> "Holy shit". The movie gives me a whole new level of appreciation for a working memory. Definitely Nolan's purest/least commercialized movie. I once heard someone say that Nolan movies have great ideas but are marred by his desire to make commercially viable films. Memento is the exception.
1. **Gone Girl**: A very romantic love story :)
1. **Nightcrawler**: It's criminal that Jake Gyllenhaal didn't get nominated as best actor for this film. Overall, the film dives into a very interesting niche of media that I don't really think about much. It's best seen as a darkly satirical take on a classic American success story seen through the eyes of a twisted optimist.

4/5 (Willing to rewatch if I'm in the mood)
-----------------------------
12. **Arrival**
1. **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri**
1. **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotted Mind**: Much like Synecdoche NY, this is very close to how much "art house" movie I can handle. Unlike Synecdoche NY, this has a much more understandable plot (compared to Synecdoche NY). I wasn't too interested in the B-plot of this movie, but the examination of choosing to lose memories and its true costs is brilliant.
1. **The Thing**: The best horror movie I've ever watched. Realistically smart characters faced with the worst of horrors and trying their best to cope. [Watts's retelling](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) from the monster's side adds a interesting dimension to the film.
1. **Interstellar**: Classic example of the "high highs, low lows" archetype. The tsunami scene (where the music represented the passing of time on Earth), the whole Mann arc (absurdly relatable), and the heel turn were highs that very few movies reach. However, the slow first third of the movie and the unbelievable "Deus Ex Machina"(much worse than the beginning) that was the ending almost ruined the movie for me. As a principle, I like to reward ambitious movies - hence why Interstellar still finds its way high on my list. Also, this is [very funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zn958rN-H4)
1. **Knives Out**: A very accessible whodunnit that I enjoyed. It's nice to watch a relatively straightforward feel good movie - looking forward to Knives Out 2.
1. **Synecdoche NY**: Impossible to give this movie a legitimate rating. In some sense, I feel like I got "Eulered" into placing this movie so high. But, there were enough stand out quotes/moment (like the ending) that struck me that I do feel this movie deserves this placement. Might rewatch after watching YMS's analysis - too much of the movie confuses me to just watch the movie again. Wouldn't surprise me if the director was a DFW fan.
1. **Being John Malkovich**: ????? I don't know what to say about this movie. I have a hard time imagining how the script writer pitched John Malkovich on this movie. One thing I thought was pretty interesting was how similar this movie was to Get Out. Both are about taking over anothers body, with some old white people secretly plotting behind the scenes. However, while Get Out is about the horror of being possessed, Being John Malkovich is about the possessors. Despite the comedy, the ending of Being John Malkovich is one of the darkest fates I've seen in any movie.
1. **Ford V Ferrari**: The second race in the movie is unbelievable. Overall, good to great performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon, a solid autobiographical script, and some standout action moments make for a very enjoyable movie.
1. **Baby Driver (rewatch)**: Plotwise, nothing special. One could likely have guessed much of it just from knowing the premise of the movie. Still, the movie manages to be entertaining partially due to stellar acting performances (particularly Jon Hamm's). However, where the movie peaks is when it starts to blend music and action (much of the cuts/movements/things that happen are synced with the music). The "Never Gonna Give You Up" scene in the diner is the pinnacle of this ideal, and in particular, the moment Buddy starts to sing the words of the song. Very fun movie, and massively entertaining.
1. **Marriage Story**
1. **Shawshank Redemption**: Loved the quote "get busy living, or get busy dying" before I even watched the movie, and the context only made it better. However, I'm somewhat disappointed with this film. Not because I disliked it - I thought it was a great film! The list of films in contention for the best movie of all time is short. Unluckily, after watching it, I'm worried that Shawshank finds its way onto this list not due its spectacular highs but due to its consistency. Most people who watch this film will consider it a great film; I doubt many people will consider it *the* greatest film.
1. **Life is Beautiful**: This movie is a pretty good rom-com mashed with an excellent holocaust-comedy (if that's a genre...). While the first half does an excellent job of characterization, the true heart of this film lies in the second half, and in particular, the ending. To be honest, despite the ending not being some kind of wild twist, the final scene affected me more than I expected.
1. **Hero**: Some critics of this film call it Chinese propaganda. I don't see it. Not moreso than any American military or anti-terrorist film. Sacrificing one's own life for the greater good isn't a new idea. Nor is it an especially China-centric one. I personally felt that the sacrifices and decisions made by the characters in this movie were meaningful. Other than the messages of the movie, the movie is objectively beautifully shot. The usage of color themes is visually striking, and there are many visual shots/styles that I don't see present in western films.
1. **Avengers: Endgame**: Enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I've never really considered myself a Marvel "fan" - I find most of the movies adequate, but most of them don't really stand out to me. I didn't even watch Infinity War in theaters. However, I do have a large amount of respect for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The level of dominance that Marvel has achieved over the last 7 years has been unprecedented, and Marvel movies have been such a cultural force over that span. Thus, I journeyed to watch this movie out of respect for the closing of an era, a pilgrimmage of sorts to the biggest movie moment in my lifespan. As for the movie itself, it banks heavily on cashing in on the emotional capital they've built up over 10 years - not that it's a bad thing. The time travel really highlighted that for me. When they showed the classic NYC Avengers shot, with the camera circling around the main cast, I thought of all the youtube videos I've seen that snippet in - Every Frame a Painting (RIP), Why CGI doesn't Suck, etc. That was great. Captain America picking up Mjolnir was another great moment. Picking up the hammer has been at the core of many great moments throughout Marvel, and that moment got the biggest cheer in my theater. Overall, Game of Thrones has shown me how badly a show can end, and I gained a lot of appreciation that this phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ended with a great movie.
1. **Mad Max Fury Road (rewatch)**: When I first watched this movie I thought it was the "perfect" film - as in, no action film could surpass this. I still believe the action set pieces in this film are near perfection ("Witness me!"), and the action scenes do encompass more character development/world building than some give credit for. But on a second watch of the film, when the glamour starts to become overwhelming, the novelty fading, the second half of the film starts to drag. All my favorite moments were in the first half, but they were memorable enough to land this movie here on my list.
1. **The Departed**: The best film about lying I've ever seen. The premise originally stuck out to me as something I'd like, but I had no idea how far they could run with this premise. If you've pretended to be someone else for so long that nobody knows you're pretending, what's the difference? Besides the incredible amounts of intrigue packed into the movie, I find the casting to be phenomenal. DiCaprio and Damon both fit perfectly into their roles, and oh wow, Marky Mark what a performance. Single handedly stole every scene he was in. I've seen some rag on Nicholson's performance, but I haven't seen enough of them to find them cliched so I simply found them very ... evocative. One thing I find interesting is simply how many A-list actors found themselves in this movie. Perhaps that's why every discussion I've seen about this movie just uses the actor's names instead of the character's names. Perhaps that's another level of "pretending to be someone else you're not". As a side note, I'm not sure how many of the meta-levels of this concept fans have analyzed into the film. Ie: Is Damon impotent? Is Nicholson impotent? Is Damon gay? Is Nicholson gay? etc.
1. **Se7en**: In some ways, the opposite of Interstellar. I watched both movies back to back on a flight. While Interstellar is a movie with great moments that's nearly ruined by the ending, Se7en is an adequate movie that's elevated to greatness by **its** 3rd act. I've heard some people say they thought the movie would still have been great without its 3rd act, and I disagree. The rest of the film was enjoyable enough, with the unique crimes and the budding relationship between Somerset and Mills, but it's the 3rd act of the film that cements this movie's place as a classic. Imagine how much less interesting the movie would have been if the villain had been your classic baddie and the movie ended with a chase sequence and shoot-out. No, the 3rd act ties the movie together and makes the film.
1. **Moonrise Kingdom**
1. **Amadeus**: Excellent character premise, and excellent character development. Unequal talent allocation is really quite tragic, and this movie presents it very well. Unfortunately, the middle of the movie dragged a bit - perhaps if I watched the theatrical cut this wouldn't be a problem.
1. **Jackie Brown**: The most un-Tarantino movie of the Tarantino movies. I've heard some people call this his most mature film, and I'd probably agree. It definitely still has some classic Tarantino-isms, like the soundtrack, but the dialogue is somewhat uncharacteristic of Tarantino (perhaps because it's a novel adaptation). Maybe I'm just immature, but I tend to like his other films more.
1. **Mulholland Drive** 
1. **Cloud Atlas**
1. **Pulp Fiction**
1. **Amélie**: The purest embodiment of happiness I've seen in a movie.
1. **The Aviator**
1. **Taxi Driver**
1. **Scott Pilgrim Vs The World**
1. **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**
1. **Primer**: This movie's plot feels like an excuse to try and write an consistent set of rules for time travel and examine how far the mechanism can be taken without breaking the rules entirely. Although the characters definitely take a backseat to the time travel, the characters are smart enough to really explore the consequences of this time travel, resulting in plenty of drama. Definitely not a movie everyone will like, but if you like smart movies/movies where your mind gets blown, this is definitely worth a watch.

3/5 (Reluctant to rewatch)
-----------------------------------
32. **Joker**
1. **Good Will Hunting**
1. **Chinatown**
1. **Spider Man: Far From Home**
1. **21 Jump Street**
1. **The Truman Show**
1. **Do the Right Thing**
1. **Dr. Strangelove**
1. **Dunkirk**
1. **Sunshine**: Very much like a worse interstellar, in more ways than one. Just like Interstellar, this movie has some incredible highs (or maybe I'm just a sucker for epic space moments), like [this one (SPOILER)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hR69EKvcW-4). Actually, I'm probably even more of a sucker for epic music paired with movie scenes ("Captain Kaneda, what do you see?"). Another thing this movie did really well was the portrayal of the Sun (and the accompanying brightness) as horror, as opposed to the typical dark = horror associations. The religious overtones around the portrayal of the sun also lent a lot of intrigue to the film. HOWEVER, the latter third of this movie fell flat for me. The movie shifted the "enemy" from the environment to a personification of the environment in a way that lost much of the intrigue that had been built up. It felt more like a B-movie slasher flick than anything else. Interstellar had something similar, but whereas I thought Dr. Mann was one of the best parts of interstellar, the villian in Sunshine was mostly boring. Oh also, re: the soundtrack - I originally was slightly taken out of the scene I linked above because I thought that they were reusing a track from a different film (which felt somewhat ... cheap). But actually, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1c2KpurNWo) was written for this film :O.
1. **The King's Speech**: Fairly solid, but ultimately forgettable. It's criminal that this won Best Picture over The Social Network.
1. **Coherence**: Less mind-bending than Primer, but a more likable character arc. Ending seemed like a bit of a cheap twist.
1. **No Country For Old Men**: Disappointed with this film. I thought I would really love this film, but left underwhelmed. There's a couple of really great scenes, notably the gas station one, but the overall tone of the movie was too nihilistic for me to appreciate.
1. **American Psycho**: Watched it for the memes, found the movie more disturbing than I thought it'd be. Christian Bale really carries the movie for me - I can't really find the core themes interesting enough to find the movie to be phenomenal. My favorite scenes from the movies are the scenes I watched before the movie that convinced me to watch the movie in the first place. Huey Lewis and the News, as well as the cardstock scene.
1. **This is Spinal Tap**: Some funny scenes - just didn't stand out that much to me.
1. **1917**: Considering I didn't really like Dunkirk that much either, maybe I just don't like war movies... I just found this movie to be somewhat bland and boring. The dialogue was just somewhat boring, the plot points were pretty repeatable, and I found the Benedict Cumberbatch cameo to actually be somewhat comedic - perhaps because it was immersion breaking. The one-take gimmick didn't really add much to my experience - at some point, I actively groaned that the one take gimmick would require the actors to actually traverse several miles. Overall, very low emotional impact, some technically impressive shots - not a movie I would like to watch again.
1. **Aladdin**: This was better than I expected. Unlike the other Disney remakes, I felt that this one had an unique heart to it. Contrary to what people may have thought from the trailers, I thought Will Smith did a phenomenal job - he was the best part of this movie by a significant margin. The emphasized role of Princess Jasmine was pretty interesting, and although I found her role to be fairly shallow (and the video was hilarious), I liked the new song.
1. **The Wandering Earth**: Watched on poor quality, halved FPS, and with a bunch of overlayed text floating around, which probably detracted from the experience. Ambitious film with some great moments (an archetype I like), I thought the final "plan" was well done. However, suffers from somewhat formulaic action sequences and some characters I didn't really care for.
1. **The Fountain**: In some sense, I was put off by this film in the same way that I'm put off by propaganda films. It's definitely a very spiritual film with some great moments, but I think I'm currently incompatible with its fundamental message. I just moved this movie's ranking from below Contagion to below The Wandering Earth, as I think the great moments (especially loved the tree of life/present day arcs) in this movie should be given credit. Definitely a candidate for "movie that might grow on me over the years".
1. **Lost in Translation**: This movie has three scenes that really stood out to me, two positively and one negatively. The karaoke scene, Charlotte looking back, and the prostitute scene. I wanted to like this movie - I really like the metaphor (maybe thanks to Kanye...), but the alienation of the Japanese jarred me in this movie. The prostitute scene in particular was incredibly uncomfortable to watch. I understand that it's necessary for the main dynamic between the leading characters, and that these scenes arguably furthered the dynamic. I just wish that it wasn't necessary to play into every Japanese stereotype to do so.
1. **Zodiac**: For me, this movie is marred by the knowledge that it's a presenting a non-mainstream view of history. A lot of the moments lose its impact for me from knowing this.
1. **Forrest Gump**: This might just be a cultural zeitgeist type of thing, but I didn't really connect with the film. None of the cultural events that happen emotionally register with me, and neither does Forrest as a character. He was sympathetic enough of a character and I rooted for him, but not enough to carry the film. Also, really didn't like Jenny in the film. I get that a lot of her manipulative actions stemmed her from her abuse as a child, but just as your parents don't excuse you from all blame, neither does Jenny's terrible past excuse her from taking advantage of Forrest for most of her life. I see why people call this a conservative movie - the army glory, Forrest overcoming his disabilities (although he was blessed with being great at running...), the self made film, the condemnation of Jenny's "alternative" lifestyle, etc. I wouldn't say its conservative - more so "traditional". Whether you consider that an euphemism or not, Forrest Gump seems like a story about the non-talented everyday American who succeeds through hard work and doing what he's told. As I said, might just be the zeitgeist of 90s America, an age where the US turned its attention from the USSR inwards and focused on itself.

2/5 (Don't see the point of rewatching)
--------------------------------
49. **Zombieland**: I think Michael Cera has a monopoly on his archetype in Hollywood (quirky awkward guy). I wonder if some writers write their scripts with him in mind. I can't imagine any other actor giving the same performance in this movie. Overall, another guilty pleasure movie. I enjoyed Tallahassee especially. Not much else to say about this movie. If you enjoy this kind of "satirical but not really" version of a zombie movie, you'll like it.
1. **Tucker and Dale vs. Evil**: Like Zombieland, a "satirical but not really" horror movie. The overwhelming emotion I felt in this movie was disbelief for how stupid the kids are. I get that's the point of the movie, but wow, those kids were dumb. Like, really dumb.
1. **Contagion**: This movie felt a bit too clinical for me. Feels like a CDC propaganda film (vaccines, anti-pseudoscience, etc.). I believe that the movie is extremely scientifically accurate - I just don't think it makes for extremely compelling cinema. Not that I didn't enjoy the movie, or that it didn't have drama. I'm just unconvinced that this kind of "drama by collective" can create a truly phenomenal movie.
1. **Alien**: I feel like this is a movie whose age really detracts from the viewing experience of the film. There were several scenes where the CGI was immersion breaking - in particular, [the scene where the alien is blasted out of the spaceship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-mmbStFrAA&t=51s). It was difficult for me to take these scenes seriously. I thought the plot was decent, and so was the world building, but the outdated effects took away from a lot of the horror of this film.
1. **Unbreakable**
1. **How To Train Your Dragon 3**: Eh. 1 >> 2 >> 3. My main issue with this film is that the villain seemed tacked on. The villains in 1 had a clear purpose, as well as the one in 2. This movie seemed to just meander around, and the villain never really seemed present throughout the movie. I learned after the movie that the villain in this movie was not the original plan, that the original plan for 2 and 3 involved Hiccup's mother fighting him, and putting the villain from 2 in the 3rd movie. This movie just seemed like a step down in stakes. I did enjoy the ending though, I was surprised that they ended on a somewhat bittersweet note. Props to the movie for doing that. Interestingly, other than who I watched the movie with, nobody else was in the movie theater when I watched this. Strange experience.
1. **Limitless**: Another guilty pleasure movie. In much the same way I enjoyed Now You See Me's omniscient villains, I enjoyed watching Eddie Morra outwit everyone else. This movie also deserves credit for popularizing the idea of nootropics. However, the movie shoots past my suspension of disbelief with how "smart" the character is. I get that writing characters that are smarter than you is hard, but Eddie gets essentially supernatural powers. I think I would really enjoy a scifi film that examined the societal effect of a mechanism that moderately increases human intelligence. Kinda like Gattaca, but extended towards brain-level effects.
1. **Godzilla: King of the Monsters**: Phenomenal trailers (perhaps the best trailers I've ever seen), but they also put 90% of the great moments in it. The human characters were forgettable.
1. **Now You See Me**: Very much so a guilty pleasure movie. Terrible movie - I didn't care about any of the characters, the twist at the end seemed convoluted and a classic example of a bad twist. Feels like the writers wanted to make The Prestige, but worse. Still, I loved the Prestige, and I tend to love magic movies and villains that seem omniscient, so I enjoyed watching the movie. Still a bad movie though.
1. **Annie Hall (unfinished)**: Watched this film because I saw someone say that Harry Met Sally and Annie Hall are two rom coms for people who don't like rom coms. I loved Harry Met Sally, but didn't care for the characters in this movie. However, this was the 7th? movie I'd watched that day and I went to sleep right after, so I've been meaning to give this movie another shot.

1/5 (Active distaste)
-------------------
59. **There Will Be Blood (unfinished)**: I watched the first half, and I wasn't very engaged. I've heard some people mention that this movie is "80% drudgery made up with some phenomenal moments", so I want to finish this film at some point.
1. **The Imitation Game**: The worst film I've watched in a long time. I just didn't care for any of the characters. The fact that this movie drastically departs from Turing's real story, pitting him against the government, the coworkers, a Russian spy, or basically anything that will characterize Turing even more as an isolated tortured genius doesn't help. I tend to have a soft spot for movies like this, but I found this movie unbelievably boring.
1. **Under The Skin (unfinished)**: I have found the limits of how much "art house" I can handle in a movie.
1. **Game of Thrones Season 8**: I will make an exception from movies for this one.

Unratable
-------------------
1. **2001: A Space Odyssey**: Doesn't seem proper to rate this as a movie. It's also difficult to rate this movie simply due to how much of a cultural icon it is.


## Zbobo :P

### S tier - Best 10/10
10 means these movies are virtually perfect. They are engaging throughout, and usually end in a way that is satisfying. There is usually some X-factor that pulls a movie up to a 10. The Fighter is the ultimate masculine fantasy. Cloud Atlas leaves you with a feeling that I can only describe as the togetherness of humanity. The Before Trilogy gives a sense of following a couple over the course of many years that I've only ever felt from watching Jim and Pam in the Office.

1. Before Trilogy - 10+/10. Together, the three movies are much stronger than the sum of it's parts. I wanted to give an 11/10, but I didn't want to break my scale and set a bad precedent.
1. When Harry Met Sally - 10/10.
1. The Fighter - 10/10. A slow start
1. Cloud Atlas - 10/10.
1. About Time - 10/10. This will certainly be a bold ranking. Movie is like a mix of When Harry Met Sally and Cloud Atlas for me. Just like Cloud Atlas, it's an ambitious film which gives you a feeling which is hard to describe.
1. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - 10/10. McDonagh is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. This movie and In Bruges were both fantastic. The characters are great. We are introduced Mildred Hayes and sympathize for her at the start. Then we find out Willoughby has cancer and suddenly morality is less clear. Dixon starts as an idiotic racist who redeems himself. Characters like James (Peter Dinklage), Penelope and Anne Hayes only appear for only a few scenes yet I feel like I really "get them". Characters are also super efficent. It's similar to a musical where in a tight knit cast every character has a relationship with the others (think Dear Evan Hansen).  The comedy is so witty. I love the scene where the ex-husband keeps making fun of his son for having cereal in his hair - so many subtle jabs. The director often sticks a tragic and comedic scene next to each other. The first one that immediately comes to mind is when Willoughby shoots himself (that was so emotional) and we go to a shot of Dixon being an idiot. McDonaugh puts a lot of focus on his setting. This is most apparent in In Bruges where Bruges represents purgatory on earth. I think this context is important for watching his films. The ending where Dixon and Mildred team up is satisfying. I love that they say that will "decide on the way".
1. Marriage Story - 10/10. This movie is similar to Before Midnight in that it feels like a realistic depiction of struggling relationships. Give me more of these and I will give them all 10s. ScarJo, Adam and the actress for Nora were all fantastic. In general, the characters were great. I liked all the lawyers and Nicole's family. I liked the simple camera work. A lot of scenes are just two or three people talking in a room and there's nothing fancy done, but the scenes feel fairly dynamic and it just works. I liked the first scene too because it introduces the characters and subverts expectations of a romantic relationship. I didn't really understand how difficult divorce is until I watched this movie. The big argument scene in Charlie's apartment crazy good. The pacing was also really good. My favorite line is "I hacked your email you dumb fuck!"
1. Before Sunset - 10/10. From the start of the movie, I wanted Jesse to take Celine in his arms and kiss her... but that never happens. There's a lingering suspense for the entire film over whether they will get back together. The film is shot in real time, which gives a much stronger sense of being "in" the movie. The little cues such as when Celine directs Jesse with "let's take a left here" give the sense of being in the present. The style in this movie is stronger and even better than the first. The best scene in the movie was Celine's outburst in the cab. There was so much emotion all at once. That's when you know the feelings are still there for both of them. The dialouge is also very good. They talk exactly the way I'd expect them to after not seeing each other for 9 years. The actors for Jesse and Celine were also producers for the film, and that shows in the development of their characters and dialogue. After the movie ended, I listened to Carmen Fantasy and I felt like I understood the piece in a way I've never felt before.
1. Before Midnight - 9.5/10. The reason this isn't a 10 is the ending wasn't satisfying to me. There's this huge climax of a fight and it's unclear how the two will resolve their issues. Then, suddenly, they made up. In the beginning of the series, an arguing couple leads to the two of them to start talking but by the end, they become that couple. It's genuinely hard to take sides during the argument and I felt so emotionally attached to the characters at that point. It's also hard for me to figure out who is right in the argument - I think that's really well done. I wanted so much for them to make up and stay together. The scene at the table was awesome - the banter between all the couples was great. I'm in agreement with Cinefix that this movie is the most honest depiction of love. It's rare to get a series of films that follow a couple over a scale of years. Most RomComs end with the couple getting together. The only thing that comes close is Pam and Jim's relationship in the Office and that took place over many years of the series. The Before Trilogy was able to capture that in three movies which is something special.

---

### A tier - Really good 8-9/10
9s are films that have something missing that deny them a 10. Ford vs Ferrari and Children of Men don't end well. Parasite is great, but it didn't have a huge effect on me post-watch unlike most 10s.
8s are above average. It's usually the minimum rating to recommend a film to others.

1. Ford vs Ferrari - 9+/10. If this is considered an action movie, it would be my favorite action movie of all time. The racing sequences were all so exciting, especially the Daytona one. I could feel my heart pounding for a five minute sequence. I don't think I've experienced that while watching a movie before... I'm glad I watched this in theaters. Damon and Bale both had great performances but Bale stood out more. There was also an interesting anti-corporation motif that rubbed off on me. I thought the ending was a bit blotched. Miles dying felt a little random, but I imagine they put it in for historical accuracy. I also wish the last race were more exciting. It felt like a character development race, unlike the Daytona one which was pure action aesthetic. Perhaps this movie is the ultimate male fantasy.
1. Silence of the Lambs - 9/10.
1. In Bruges - 9+/10. Feel like there were two reasons to make this film: to insult Belgium for 1.5 hours and (SPOILER) the scene where Ken is trying to kill Ray who is killing himself. (1/19/20 Update: bumped to 9+, because it's the best movie in it's genre)
1. Children of Men - 9/10.
1. Citizen Kane - 9/10. I watched this at 1.4x but I think it deserves a watch at normal speed. This movie would make a good audio. Beginning was a little weird. Like Casablanca, it starts in a documentary style. Kane is introduced as an incredibly interesting character. I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn more about his life. He reminded me of a character from Atlas Shrugged - idealistic, adheres to principles (in particular, I'm thinking about the scene where he completes the negative opera review). I feel like Kane is somehow a victim of circumstance, which is strange because he has all the money in the world. I was left with a sense of existential dread at the end. Is childhood the best there will be?
1. Parasite - 9/10. I thought this was a horror movie - it's not. I thought this movie was going to be something like Contagion where some insects destroy humanity. In the middle of the movie, I thought "I wish there were a more defined main character" because you see close-ups on the father a lot but he splits time with the rest of the cast. After watching a video, I found out that the director also did Snowpiercer and things started to make a lot more sense (Every Frame a Painting has a video on how the protagonist of Snowpiercer has to choose between left and right through a series of closeups). For the most part, the directing did not feel like that from a foreign film. I was also reminded of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - this film is similar in that the first acts are exclusively on character development. There are tensions that rise bit by bit and it culminates into an explosive third act. Because it's not an American film, there are no guns, just knives. Each character is constructed well. The set design is immaculate, particularly the Park family home. The portrayal of both families are done well and the class disparity is culturally relevant. The plot moves a bit slowly in the middle when the last members of the family are recruited. One memorable shot was when the first introduction to the basement. There's a tracking shot that feels immersive.
1. Zodiac (rewatch) - 9/10. I was close to putting this movie above Silence of the Lambs, so I think there's been some overall rating inflation. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie and the pacing was very good. I'm always impressed when three hour movies don't feel long. The third act of this movie where Jake enters center stage is the most interesting. Now that I live in the bay, this movie feels closer to home to me. Although the movie biases towards a particular suspect which is supposedly not accurate, I find it entertaining nonetheless.
1. Do the Right Thing - 8.5/10. This movie is similar to Three Billboards - all the characters, even the minor ones, have particular personalities; the network of characters is densely populated; it's all about conflict. The beginning was a little slow but after most of the characters are introduced, the middle of the film is just a series of tiny tiny conflicts. Everyone is bickering with each other. The conflicts merge into a tragic climax. It reminds me of the riots in the Joker. I wanted so badly for everyone to make peace and go home! Sal was such an interesting character. So many moments where you think "wow he's a great guy" and then he goes back to being a crank. I also liked Da Mayor. There are no real good guys. It's hard for me to figure out who is right and who is wrong. The real villain is the heat (and the police). I am reminded of the line "Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime" from Devil in a New Dress.
1. Casablanca - 8.5/10. I usually don't like old movies but this one was pretty good. Because it's old, I'm a bit more lenient when they have cheesy tropes. I loved the way they introduced Rick's character. I wish there was a bit less exposition on his whole "I don't stick my neck out for anyone" (he says it explicitly a lot). The big quotes from the movie were a bit lost on me - what the fuck does "Here's looking at you kid" mean? Why does he say it to his lover? The other line "Louie, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship" also wasn't particularly resonant. The emphasis on the setting of the movie reminded me of In Bruges. Casablanca isn't purgatory persay, but it is a kind of Limbo. Rick was the only standout character; I was not a huge fan of anyone else. I definitely could sense that this was a movie from a different time - the women feel more like plot catalyst than characters. Most notable scenes for me were when Rick drank after seeing Ilsa and when they started singing La Marseillaise over the Germans.
1. Chinatown - 8.5/10. This movies makes the audience focus on the details the same way a private investigator would. We ask the same questions that Gittes does. There's a big reveal that Mrs. Mulwray's secret is her sister/daughter. This reminded me of Mr. Robot where it's revealed that Elliot was abused as a child. I'm not sure why but I'm not a huge fan of this stuff. I wanted Chinatown to be about the water and some conspiracy behind it. In Mr. Robot, I wanted it to be about hacking and society, not "people problems". The movie is super tight. There is no scene that's wasted and each one reveals some clue that is used in the future. My favorite example is when Mulwray bangs her head on the steering wheel and that turns out to be the way she dies. Towards the end, I got a sense that the ending was going to be like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. That is, we had a fairly slow plot with unrelated characters that all clashes in a huge action packed climax where a lot of people die. That's not far from what actually happened. The pacing was a little slow at times. There were a lot of characters and honestly they looked pretty similar. I also couldn't figure out all the character's motivations. I felt a lot of paranoia over who were the good and bad guys. I was confused for a large part of the movie. I'm pretty satisfied with the plot - Gittes reveals that he used be a cop that didn't give a shit. He develops a sense of compassion and he has some sense of morality that drives him to solve the case (he doesn't seem to care about the money). He ultimately fails at saving the person he was trying to protect and that causes him to rebound back to his old self - "As little as possible." <There was a posthoc bump from 8- to 8.5 after watching the Maltese Falcon>
1. The Lobster - 8.5/10. Very interesting idea, dialogue was super unsettling. Great directing to make such a creepy tone. A surprisingly good movie.
1. Synecdoche NY - 8.5/10.
1. Schindler's List (rewatch) - 8.5/10. Feel like I matured a bit since my first watching a couple years ago. The score and Itzhak was really well done.
1. Brokeback Mountain - 8/10. This movie takes the cute scenes that are part of a normal romance movie and invents the gay equivalent. That was so well done. Gyllenhaal (Jack fucking Twist) has another great performance and I'm interested in watching more movies that he stars in. Was a shock when he died.
1. Goodfellas - 8/10. This movie made me realize I like mob movies. The cast was very similar to The Irishman. I know the plot was going to be similar but I will eat that shit up. The start of the movie is iconic. Highlight is how any times "busting my balls" was said.
1. Lost in Translation - 8/10.
1. The Aviator - 8/10. This movie felt like the precessor to "The Wolf of Wallstreet". I think three hour movies are usually pretty hard to sit through but Scorsese makes it work. Katherine Hepburn actor was fantastic, the [accent was very interesting](https://youtu.be/NvDvESEXcgE?t=680). Favorite lines in the movie were "hot dog" and "golly". Lots of memorable scenes - the lightbulbs crunching on the red carpet, Hughes' film projected onto his body, Hughes meets the Hepburns. Ben Wyatt and Galvin Belson have cameos in the movie.
1. Breakfast at Tiffany's - 8/10. I wanted to see this movie after watching the opening scene. I like that the movie has a theme (Moon River), that is played throughout. Audrey Hepburn had a standout performance. The first movie I watched from her was Roman Holiday - her character in both movies are quite similar. I want to see some more of her work. These aren't my words but there was a great job capturing the bohemian lifestyle of New York in the time. This is a pretty good rom com.
1. Avengers: Endgame - 8/10
1. The Greatest Showman - 8/10. This movie was part of an experiment - what happens if I listen to a movie before watching it? I listened to the movie audio of the Greatest Showman over the course of the previous week. Doing a listen through the movie definitely attributed to the high rating. Results were interesting! The film was much more colorful than I expected, and I paid a lot more attention to it. Charity and the daughters had a color palette that was different from the rest of the cast. I saw [the movie poster](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreatest-Showman-Companion-Exclusive-Interviews%2Fdp%2F1788701542&psig=AOvVaw0jNnwoKGzNFTJFpszG2MPJ&ust=1574623103948000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOjj06GGgeYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) so while listening, I imagined that everything in the movie was blue. I did not expect the Lettie to be a bearded woman, although I did think that she was black. I only knew Hugh Jackman was the movie (but a friend spoiled that Zac Efron and Zendaya were in this movie). The movie gives a lot of screen time Zendaya but especially in the beginning, it's just scenes of her looking at Zac so I missed this entire romantic subplot. This is why even after knowing Zendaya was in the movie, I had no idea which character she was. Prior to watching the movie, I really wanted to see the Rewrite the Stars scene because I liked that song the most. I decided to wait and it was so worth it! That scene is fucking amazing!! The song is so much more powerful with the visuals. I have a similar feeling about Million Dreams to a lesser extent. Jenny was more attractive in the movie than in my head. The plot is relatively simple, but I've come to expect that of musicals. It's reeeeeeeeally similar to Hamilton - Barnum is Hamilton; Charity is Eliza; Jenny is Angelica; the main character's ambition causes him to lose sight of what is truly important.
1. Joker - 8/10. The high rating is for how the film made me feel. At first, I didn't really want to see the film, but after reading the accompanying culture war, I decided it would be worth. I enjoyed watching this in the theater to gauge other people's. The film can be uncomfortable to watch at times. Some online communities think the media is dumb for describing this film as a banner call for incels. I disagree... The protagonist is a loner who ultimately gains admiration for violence. Perhaps the difference between this and something like American Psycho is it's a lot more personable. I found myself enjoying this movie a lot more than Taxi Driver. The broad strokes of both plots are relatively similar. Maybe it's the little Batman universe plot points throughout the movie that make it more exciting (I love Nolan's Batman movies.) The plot is not particularly strong. There are lots of scenes that disturb my suspension of belief. I normally don't like movies with a weak plot, but the "effect" of the film makes up for it. I recall leaving the theater feeling really shitty. The laughs that Arthur makes were fucking creepy, really well done. Parts of the Gotham City setting feel out of place. To my understanding, it's suppose to represent NYC sometime in the 20th century. Some of the problems in Gotham (high crime rate) don't exist today. Of course, there's income inequality which is relevant. I love this quote from Todd Phillips: "I literally described to Joaquin at one point in those three months as like, ‘Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film’…. It was literally like ‘Let’s make a real movie with a real budget and we’ll call it f–ing Joker’."

1. Good Will Hunting (rewatch) - 8/10. (Only because rewatch)
1. The Departed (rewatch) - 8/10.
1. Coherence - 8/10. (1/17/20: bumped down a bit)
1. Devil Wears Prada (rewatch) - 8/10.
1. Drive (second watch) - 8/10. In my original watch, I put this movie in the F tier. What changed? First, I watched it at 2x speed. There are a lot of moments in the movie that feel super slow. The driver doesn't talk much and there are times were we just watch the LA street view. Being able to speed through those parts made it more enjoyable. My tastes have changed a bit since I last saw this movie. There's a lot of violence and gore in this movie that originally felt distasteful, but after watching films like The Hateful Eight, OUATH, and Parasite I've grown more accustom to it. The violence in this film serves an important purpose. After watching films like Casablana, Maltese Falcon, Chinatown, and Citizen Kane, the "character study of a male anti-hero" trope is more interesting (this is the noir element right?). Chinatown might be the closest example, where a character has a dark and mysterious past and has a choice between light and darkness. In Drive, we see that take place in the elevator, where he stomps on the guys face one too many times and it's clear he can't live a normal life no matter how he tries. That reddit post that talked about Drive being the "ultimate male fantasy" added some much needed context for me. I liked the soundtrack. The intro with Nightcall felt right. The outro might be one of my favorite song outros - the chorus repeats "A real human being, a real hero" as the Driver drives away. Ryan Gosling does a great job. He doesn't have too much dialogue but he really nails the coolness of his character. A lot of his acting in this movie is just shots of his face.
1. Spiderman: Far From Home - 7.5/10. This movie far exceeded my expectations and part of the reason for the high rating is because the theater made the experience much better. I liked the meta comments about super heros, the world building of the post Iron Man death world. The fight sequence that ends with Spiderman being hit by the train was one of the coolest I've seen, I love when everything goes quiet. In general, Spiderman has to be my favorite action movie franchise. I like that Spiderman fights with some strategy since he is not the strongest being.

### C tier - OK Movies 5-7/10
7s are okay. There are a lot of movies that are passable. It was enjoyable to watch, but nothing special about it. I find that many things I watch in the theater are 7s because they are decent and watching in theaters can give the movie a little boost. Lots of franchise stuff like Toy Story, Alaadin or Avengers would end up here. I wouldn't enthusiastically rewatch this movies.
6s are 5s with some redeeming qualities. Mad Max has great set design but the plot was poor so it wasn't that engaging to watch. TGTBTU has a spectacular end but is otherwise long and uninteresting. Snowpiercer is ruined by its ending. Harold and Kumar is funny but Bad
5s are barely enjoyable films. After the movie, I think to myself "by the slightest margin, that was more enjoyable than being on reddit or youtube for the past two hours"

1. Jojo Rabbit - 7.5/10. Cute movie that reminded me of the Grand Budapest Hotel. I was doing work in parallel so I didn't pay full attention to the movie. Most of the characters were charming. ScarJo was very good. The Nazi guy was cool and his end was very sad. Jojo was well acted and his fat friend came in at funny times. I wasn't a huge fan of the Jewish girl.
1. The Tree of Life - 7.1/10. Watched about half of this movie with Horace before we went to sleep. I guess it's an ambitious film, but honestly it's really confusing. The premise is simple enough - an adult reflecting on his memories to figure out why he is who he is. I didn't understand that until reading explainations of the film. A lot of confusing sequences (the Big Bang up until dinosaurs etc.) Ending of the movie was meh. Brad Pitt did a nice job as a stern father and they built up his character well. I did like how they depicted the life of a surburban kid's upbringing, it does remind me of mine, and I recognize that that is hard to do.
1. Spiderman: into the Spiderverse - 7+/10. It's a cute movie. Stylistically, it's interesting. The animation is well done and the soundtrack deserves recognition but the plot wasn't particularly interesting. Perhaps I would have been more engaged if I knew the villains, rather Octo lady was just a villain like any other and didn't particularly pull me in. The anime, noir, and porky spider men were cool. A lot of this movie is good, but because I didn't enjoy it that much, it remains in C tier.
1. A Star is Born - 7/10. I watched this movie for the plot, so I actually skipped all the scenes where they scene, even the last one, (except for Shallow). I'm glad he died at the end, made sense.
1. Crazy, Stupid, Love - 7/10. (1/17/20: I'm not sure why this is was a 6/10, I bumped it up)
1. The King's Speech - 7/10.
1. Primer - 7/10.
1. The Thing (1982) - 7/10.
1. Scott Pilgrim v. The World - 7/10. (1/17/20: Slight post-hoc bump because of the music and some memorable scenes)
1. Detective Pikachu - 7?/10. Love seening Pokemon, but didn't add this so I forgot a lot of the movie.
1. A Few Good Men - 7/10. Part of the reason I watched this movie is because on /r/moviesuggestions, it was cited as a movie with a competent villain. I don't completely agree. One of the main attractions for this movie was Jack Nicholson's monologue. It didn't really live up to the hype for me. Tom Cruise is a baller. Military law is weird.
1. Avengers, Infinity War - 7/10 Exactly the movie I expected. Was much more enjoyable watching on Netflix because I could skip through scenes that I found boring. Otherwise, this would be a 5/10
1. Annie Hall (rewatch) - 7/10. I saw this the first time after watching two other movies that day. Horace and I ended up stopping halfway. I was inspired to watch this movie because I saw a video about 500 Days of Summer and this movie was mentioned as the rom-com of its generation. Through that lense, the movie was a lot more interesting. I watched this at 1.5x. Overall, a bit more appreciation for the film but nothing spectacular.
1. American Psycho - 7/10.
1. Contagion - 7/10.
1. Toy Story 4 - 7/10. I watched the first Toy Story, and probably the 2nd and 3rd although I don't remember. It was okay. I made a joke about organ harvesting when Woody went into that creepy shop, and it turned out that's actually what happened. I don't like how in kids movies, the bad guy turns good. Bo Peep is so awesome. I love competence.
1. Aladdin - 7/10. Exceeded my expectations. I liked the songs (Speechless was hilarious in the movie but I like the song, Prince Ali, Friend Like Me). The plot in the beginning with the lamp was rushed.
1. Ghost in the Shell - 7/10. I watched this movie sped up as well. I didn't completely understand the politics going on between the different sectors and that might be because of the speed. I thought there were some interesting philosophical questions.
1. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - 7/10. So much anticipation for this movie but the plot moved so slowly. Margot Robbie barely did anything and had almost no dialogue. Leaving the theater, my rating was a lot lower, but after looking at the reviews, I understood the movie better: the Manson family + murders, Margot Robbie had a great performance. The ending was pretty fun to watch and Brad Pitt's character was soooo badass.
1. Moneyball - 6.9/10. I will watch every single movie made from a Michael Lewis book. I also think I enjoy sport movies. I did not like the scenes of the GM and his daughter.
1. Before Sunrise - 6.5/10. The characters weren't very likable separately and as a couple. I love [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSnAaf9r8Ow) though - two people pretending to talk to a friend to express how they truly feel about each other. I also find myself wanting to finish the triology. I do like the idea of watching a couple over the years, similar to Jim and Pam in the Office. Also, the girl is fucking scary. I keep thinking she's gonna kill him.
1. The Royal Tenenbaums - 6.5/10. Movie felt slow and a bit random. It was not narrative driven. Margot is an interesting character with an iconic sense of fashion that alone makes this movie worth watching. My favorite scene was the "Hey Jude" playing over their introduction as characters.
1. Mad Max: Fury Road - 6/10.
1. The Good the Bad and the Ugly - 6/10. So long, not good; Edit 3/8: Music is good, bump up 2 ranks!
1. American Beauty - 6/10. I loved the beginning. If the entire movie were Lester monologuing, I would have enjoyed it immensely. I found all the characters to be deplorable (in a good way). Directing style is strange, uses a lot of playbacks. I can see why the movie is iconic. Lester has a nice redemption arc.
1. Snowpiercer - 6/10. This is my second time watching the movie. My impressions are about the same - I think the ending sucks and it totally blotches the movie. Why do they destroy the train and kill all of humanity? Why does the main character condone this? Personally, I would have preferred if he became the conductor as planned.
1. Crazy Rich Asians - 6/10. The texting sequence in the opening scene was really cool. I remember when texting was first introduced in Season 1 of House of Cards. The way it's shown has really progressed in a good way. The wedding and the water was also really cool. Besides that, it feels like any other rom com, except with Asian people. I did not like the Majong scene at all.
1. Harold and Kumar go to White Castle - 6/10. This is difficult to rate because it's the first movie that's "so bad, it's good". It's a funny movie with more character development than 1917.
1. 1917 - 6/10. There were a few cool shots like the waterfall scene. I felt scammed when the pudgy boy died thirty minutes into the movie. Overall, the one-shot limit made the movie feel super slow. Espeically in the beginning where all they do is walk. The ending was also quite lackluster. He gets a "fuck-off" and has a "emotional" moment with the brother. I wasn't particularly moved. After this movie and Dunkirk, I think it's possible that I just don't like war movies very much. WW1 also seems less interesting to me than WW2.
1. The Fountain - 6/10. Cool visuals and good soundtrack, but otherwise a budget Cloud Atlas
1. The Two Popes - 6/10. The movie was cute but a bit cliche. The popes felt one dimensional. Classic leader who doesn't want to lead trope.
1. The Maltese Falcon - 5.5/10. This is really a review of Chinatown. The beginnings of both movies are incredibly similar. The femme fatale comes in and hires our protagonist. She is mysterious and arouses suspicion We are introduced to a character who dies a few scenes later. Our PI falls in love with the femme fatale. Okay, if this is the first "noir film", then a lot of progress was made in 30 years. In Chinatown, we follow the PI and see the same clues that he sees. In Falcon, the clues are mainly revealed by people - there's nothing for me to figure out at any point and I feel like a spectator. The romance in the movie feels so strange/forced. I didn't really understand that they were in love with each other; I thought Sam was just a womanizer. They profess their love for each other at the end, where the fuck did that come from?? Now I see the spin on the femme fatale from Chinatown. Sam has some really clever scenes where he "Harvey Spectre"'s everyone else. Not a good film in isolation, but it made me appreciate Chinatown much more.
1. Frozen 2 - 5.5/10. Honestly, I'll watch any Frozen sequel, I like the characters (Anna) enough. Character development kinda sucked though. Olaf is in some philosophical phase that doesn't make too much sense to me. He keeps talking about change... who is the target audience here? The kids that watched Frozen that are older now? There was a decent amount of expoisition to say that everyone is a few years older now (Oh I see the first movie came out six years ago so the Frozen universe is in real time.) That's actually pretty cool. I think something similar goes in in HTTYD and the Before Trilogy and it works out well. Anna... I really wish she got some powers. There was some plot points about her being powerless so I thought she would have some kind of magic. Instead she becomes the queen. Honestly that was a big twist for me - should she really be queen...? Kristoff has the stupidest arc, he's basically a blubbering idiot the entire movie. I couldn't believe what I was watching when I saw his solo song. It felt so out of place in Frozen. Elsa makes negative progress as a person? We dedicated an entire movie to her not shutting others out and she does it again (not in a redeeming way either, she does it towards the end!) Plot wasn't great either. Who is the person singing? There was so much anticipation for it but I left that scene confused. Was it their dead mother? Was it Elsa the entire time? Why did Elsa freeze? What happened to the parents? This was a man vs nature type movie which is unique, I suppose. The film itself is also a lot darker than the first, both in color and mood. As an aside, the Into the Unknown melody is basically [this](https://youtu.be/zr18GgCvVQs?t=155). The music was not amazing. The mysterious melody did get stuck in my head though and it seems like "Into the Unknown" is suppose to be the flagship song (I'm basing this off the fact that Weezer and Panic! did covers of this song). I feel kinda snubbed with "Show Yourself" though. Who was it? The theme just doesn't have the same appeal as "Let it Go". The animation was absolutely amazing. I remember the Elsa running into the ocean scene from the trailer. The way that scene ends with her taming the horse is awesome. I enjoyed every scene with the water horse. The chameleon was ok as well but I wish it actually did something. The callbacks to Frozen 1 were good too - Olaf summarizing the plot and Elsa listening to herself sing Let it Go. This time around, I notice that Frozen has a top notch cast! Idina (Elsa) played Elphaba, Kristen Bell(Anna)... Well Eleanor from the Good Place which is top notch to me, Johnathan Groff (Kristoff) is King George in Hamilton and Jon Gadd (Olaf) is Elder Cunningham in Book of Mormon. These are big names in the musical world!
1. The Wandering Earth - 5.5/10. Ambitious movie and I like end of the world movies which is why it's this high. However, I don't like the changing of plans. Feels Deus Ex Machina
1. Dunkirk - 5.5/10. 5 means the movie was barely enjoyable and that's how I felt about this film. Generally, don't like war movies. The beginning of the movie is very slow.
1. Limitless - 5/10.
1. Hell or High Water - 5/10. This movie just felt so cookie cuter... The Sheriff who's a few weeks out of retirement, some bank robbers, in the West. Basically, this movie was nothing special. Also, I'm done watching films about the West. I don't have a particular complaint, but I guess the guns get old for me. (For reference, I've watched the Good the Bad, and the Ugly, There Will Be Blood, No Country For Old Men, probably some others that I'm forgetting... and I've had enough of this genre, it is NOT for me)
1. Being John Malkovich - 5/10. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1. Alien - 5/10. This movie was barely enjoyable. This is incredibly disappointing to me because it's quite highly rated from many sources. The CGI is outdated so the film wasn't scary at all. The monster doesn't move in a lifelike way (a modern day remake could make the difference) and the explosion of the main ship was laughable. The characters go out one by one and get picked off by the Alien. I was a little annoyed that the Alien grew into it's full form after a few hours leaving Kane's stomach. I also had a hard time processing what happened in all of the action scenes. The only reason this is not <4/10 is because there was a nice twist that the science officer is a robot. This explained all of his questionable actions, but adds a plothole of why he is a robot but the rest of the crew is human.
1. Game Night - 5/10. The opening sequence of the movie is a pleasure to watch. The "one shot" action scene in the house with the fight club is well done. I credit these to David Fincher. [The homage to flight club was awesome!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sh1dAqc-UA) The the middle and end were too actiony and not as entertaining. The plot and dialogue are very "bad moviesque". This movie feels like a breath of fresh air after watching things from the 1940's for the past few weeks. Besides all this positives, everything else was pretty bad. It certainly wasn't as funny as I'd want a comedy to be. The trailer is quite good which is a huge bait.
1. Taxi Driver 5/10 - Ending ?????? -> okay (1/17/20 update: I think that just like Drive, I would enjoy this more on rewatch)
1. Our Time - 5-/10. This certainly is no Citizen Kane. The entire movie could have been 30 minute short film. It could have even been 10 minutes. It was two hours but it felt super slow. The two movies I watched before this were Chinatown and Casablanca. Both movies have good "narrative economy" in contrast to this film, which has many unnecessary scenes. I don't usually like foreign films and this one follows that trend. The directing style is different from Hollywood - fast forwarding and flashbacks feel weird to me. I also don't like movies about high school, although the Chinese HS setting interesting. I read a review about Casablanca that said "two cliches make us laugh, a hundred cliches move us". Why doesn't that apply to this movie? It's no fun watching Lin being an idiot. I hate incompetent female characters. The most notable scene was when all the boys crowded around the one guy with the book. Close second is Chinese Highschool Spartacus/Dead Poet's Society. Overall, it was barely enjoyable - the lowest possible rating that isn't F tier.
1. Circle - 5-/10. this was barely worth watching

### F tier - did not enjoy <4/10
These movies suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

1. Uncut Gems - 4/10. Why is this considered a good movie? I feel like not a lot happens... He gets the opal, he gives the opal away, he tries to get it back and fails a lot. Then he gets it back. It auctions for less money so he bets it off. Then he dies. A lot of screentime is just screaming - "fuck you, you cocksucker, fuck you pal, you fucking bit me. What the fuck did you say? ..." Idina Menzel's performance was good and it was interesting to see her in a different setting. The family scene was the best. Besides that, I didn't find the plot very engaging. Obviously you want him to get the opal back, but that feels like such a cheap way to get you hooked on the movie. It's like clickbate. Adam Sandler's character is super sleazy and I didn't care for him at all. I didn't care that he was failing or that he succeeded or even that he died. Let's talk about the ending - is the fact that he gets shot suppose to be some big wow? It feels random to me. I imagine that the people who enjoy this movie would say "wow what a poignant ending". I don't see that at all. It was sudden and it happened, but it was nothing special. This movie sucked.
1. The Pursuit of Happyness - 4/10. This movie had a lot of potential. I thought the beginning was great and after 15 minutes, I wanted to see more. I thought Jaiden was cute but that's about it for the positives. The whole plot with the wife was random. I didn't understand why she left and why she left the son. It's very strange for a character to be a part of the first part of the movie and just leave. I was looking forward to an underdog story about hard work and achievement and becoming a stockbroker but I didn't get that. You don't really see him at work, and it's only in montages. His meeting the pension fund CEO was a bit random too. The 'I title this part of my life _____' also seemed a bit drab. Maybe the problem is the movie adhered to the real life story too much (I didn't know going in that this was 'based on a real story'). Maybe the story itself was not interesting anyway. I had higher expectations from the beginning, but this suuuucked
1. Annie Hall - 4/10.
1. The Lion King - 4/10. I'm not a huge fan of this movie in the first place and the live action remake was even worse. The characters don't show any emotion through their faces and animals talking in english is weirder when they look realistic. Kid Simba was cocky and annoying. Adolescent Simba was totally nihilistic and still annoying. The animation was pretty cool, looked like animal planet. Yeah, I also just find the story stupid, not really inspiring.
1. Unbreakable - 4/10. Pacing was slow. They spent so much time convincing us that the main character was unbreakable. We GET IT, he is unbreakable!!! The twist ending is not satisfying at all. This was recommended as a movie where the villain is competent. Unclear if that was the case. Horace picked this movie and it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked.
1. Steve Jobs - 4/10. This movie suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. I have this gripe dramatizations because the question "did this _really_ happen?" takes me out of the immersion. The movie is about Steve's relationship with everyone else. The movie is divided into three acts. It's *VERY* convenient that each relationship features a bit of development and every time, it's in the 30 minutes right before the presentation. Yeah I don't buy it. I think for this topic, a documentary would be far more interesting. Also, Jobs is an asshole and has no redeeming qualities. I hoped that he would acknowledge the Apple II in the last presentation, but nope. Perhaps I identify more with Woz because I am an engineer. Some scenes are pretty cool but overall, the film was not enjoyable at all.
1. There Will Be Blood (unfinished) - 3/10.
1. Mulholland Drive - 3/10. Horace framed this movie as the "ultimate feminine fantasy". Apparently it's also considered the best film of the 21st century. Second to Brokeback Mountain, I was quite excited to watch this movie. And it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. The most enjoyable part was teasing Qian with Horace about what "ultimate feminine fantasy" was referring to. She got mad whenever we said it, so we started passing a packet of M&Ms to codify what we meant. This movie was incredibly confusing. At least half the scenes don't make sense. I lost interest around halfway into the film and suddenly the main actors play a new character with a different name. It took a 20 minute video to explain the movie and I wasn't satisfied afterwards. The actor for Betty/Diane was superb. The audition scene was also excellent.
1. Drive - 0+/10.
1. Under The Skin (unfinished) 0/10 - This movie suuuuuuuuuucked!
1. My Neighbor Totoro (unfinished) 0/10 - I guess I don't really like kids movies. I didn't really get the conflict and didn't feel compelled to finish the movie so it suuuuuuuucked.

**S (10/10)**
1. **Harry Met Sally**: One of the first movies that I saw where I never really felt bored, didn't see big flaws in any part of the movie, and at multiple moments in the film was incredibly impressed with the framing of the shots. The way that it's cut with interviews with couples threw me off a bit first, but ended up being really charming as well.
1. **Parasite**: As a movie, I think it should be enjoyed without much knowledge
about it going in. Beyond being captivating from start to finish, I found
Parasite to showcase great set design and cinematography, especially in the
scene in the middle of the movie with the coughing housekeeper. For a decent
chunk of the movie, I forgot that I was watching a foreign film, but knowledge
of Korean culture certainly seems to elevate it further. Another great movie.
Unsure about whether to put this above or below Parasite, so I'll put it below
for now. I will probably watch Snowpiercer and The Host because of it.

**A (9/10)**
1. **Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri**: I thought this was going to be a really artsy movie that I wouldn't enjoy, but I thought that the characters were really fascinating.
1. **Good Will Hunting**
1. **Silence of the Lambs**
1. **Casablanca**: If you're thinking that this movie doesn't hold up, that it is boring because it is in black and white, or that the tropes introduced in this movie would have long-become cliche, don't worry. I found this movie refreshingly relatable outside of a few moments where Ilsa transforms into a helpless plot point instead of a person. This movie could have been a 10/10 but there were a few too many moments with an awkward timing or non-sequitor, perhaps because of the age of the film. Zaibo made the movie watching experience worse since he knew a few details going into it and was waiting for certain lines to be said. Spoiler ahead: I also was positively surprised that despite the happy ending, it was still bittersweet for Rick. Casablanca is effective at telling a love story without it being only a love story.
1. **Miss Americana**

**B (8/10)**
1. **The Aviator**: I don't know how to feel about this movie. I enjoyed each scene, but the movie starts to drag on due to its length. Also, it was kind of neat but it was also about some guy I don't really care about.
1. **Avengers: End Game**: Actually kind of similar to The Aviator, in that nothing in particular was terrible but it dragged on. Also, time travel sucks and moments felt like pandering. Not just the women charging scene, which was really dumb, but also lots of moments where Captain America did cool things and various power level imbalances (why didn't Captain Marvel do more?).
1. **Coherence**
1. **Chinatown**: My movie rankings are not based on historical impact or cultural significance, which would move Chinatown up the list. While I enjoyed the movie's numerous trope reversals and the continual references to what could have been throwaway moments in the first act, I thought that the movie demanded too much of the viewer. Part of the problem may have come from simply confusing the characters with each other. In terms of technical aspects such as lighting or Nicholson and Huston's performances, the movie was impressive as well. I could see this movie rising in my rankings as I think about it more, but ultimately it was somewhat disappointing compared to expectations.
1. **Ghost in the Shell**: I wish I could have enjoyed this movie more. I'm
certain that if I followed it up with delving deeper into the lore of the
various other adaptations that I would better appreciate the subtleties of this
film, but on its own it's fairly confusing. Still pretty enjoyable for an
animated film from over twenty years ago.
1. **The Greatest Showman**
1. **Primer**
1. **Before Sunrise**: A slow start, but then the last hour sped by and I forgot I was even watching a movie. I might have been biased by Zaibo's review but I did find that I desperately wanted to start the next movie to learn out more.
1. **Scott Pilgram v. The World**
1. **Brokeback Mountain**
1. **Spider Man: Far From Home**

**C (7/10)**
1. **American Psycho**
1. **The Maltese Falcon**: We watched this for insight into Chinatown. Yet when the movie ended, I felt more confused than ever. Why was there barely anything shown on screen? Almost everyone gets shot off screen, there are a ton of points left unexplained, and the romance plots begged to be better fleshed out. In particular, why was Archer's wife even relevant after we determine that Spade didn't kill Archer? One example of what is wrong with this film is that there was no indication that the love between Spade and O'Shaughnessy was real, which perhaps was the point. However, the constant lying and twists meant that I couldn't take anything for face value, making me not both investing any effort into trying to figure out what was really happening. After all, why bother when nothing is real and everyone is lying anyway? There were a number of shots which now simply feel dated and juvenile, most noticeably the obvious upward angle when Spade and Gutman are speaking at Gutman's apartment to make Gutman appear more imposing. It may have been more effective if it had been less obvious, used for less time, or even if Spade and Gutman weren't clearly the same height. For a famous movie, I expected the film to feel memorable.
1. **Children of Men**: I put this movie up here not because of a good plot but mostly out of respect for the cinematography on display.
1. **Mad Max: Fury Road** - This is the last good movie on the list; there's a heavy drop-off. Surprisingly good, funny, and more memorable than it has any right to be, perhaps because of memability. A rare C movie I'd watch again.

**D (6/10)**
1. **Captain Marvel**
1. **Our times**: Unlike the movies below this one, it was actually kind of enjoyable to watch, with the knowledge that it was going to be cliche as all hell and full of cheesy, awkward tropes. Any movie that I would consider watching again or enjoyed means that it shouldn't be an F in my mind. With that in mind, why does it deserve an D? I understand that it is a very different style, yet by the end of it the excessive narration and flashbacks were far too frustrating. At one point, the main male character had monologued for two or three minutes, followed by another taped monologue for another few minutes. It also felt like the director wanted see how many times he could go for a shot that was supposed to be a shocking reveal, yet have everyone watching say "I knew it" when they see it. There's no need to revisit the same scene three or four times, with the same slow pans. This isn't the Clue movie. Still, there is some charm in the hopeless romanticism and over-the-top dramatics, and if you're looking for something where you can turn your head off and yell about the movie and talk over it without missing anything, this might be the movie for you.

**F (1-5/10)**
1. **Drive**: 4/10
1. **American Beauty**: 4/10
1. **Unbreakable**: 2/10
1. **Limitless**: 2/10. I went into this movie hoping it would be a fun, indulgent exploration of what it would be like to be addicted to a drug that made you brilliant. Instead, I got a childless, mindless exploration of what it would be like being addicted to a drug that made you godlike, and then wasting it, and then somehow ending up on top of the world without ever deserving it.
1. **Under The Skin**: 0/10. We left this movie unfinished. Thank goodness, because it was pretty unwatchable. It felt like someone went to film school for a year, thought "hey, I can do this," and then dropped a fat load of money to blackmail Scarlett Johansson into actng in it without learning plot, characters, or when do use certain shots. This is the only one unfinished because of the movie being terrible, and also totally felt like a waste of time.

1. none yet

### D tier - 4/10, bad, not worth my time, but had a signficantly large number of decently enjoyable moments

1. none yet

### F tier - 1-3/10, very bad, definitely not worth my time

1. American Psycho: "Although it's first on the list, I give this at most a three out of ten." Decent premise of a neurotic businessman who can't contain his neuroticism and goes on secret killing rampages as a result. Mostly kind of a pointless movie about how society at large doesn't care about the wrongdoing of the upper class as long as surrounding individuals can maintain their bottom line and make money. Pretty banal message. A bit gory at times, overall not particularly necessary. 3/10.
1. Unbreakable: At first, I thought this was a bit of a cute movie about a medically fragile man, "Mr. Glass", looking to find a superhero by becoming a real-life villain perpetrating various homicidal crimes. Overall the pacing was far too slow, almost sluggish at times. Small twist at the end. Overall, decent but unremarkable. 3/10.

### Garbage tier - 0/10, refuse in the form of a film

1. Children of Men: Frenzied, melodramatic pile of garbage. This film is about a post-apocalyptic society that has become infertile. During the movie, a woman is found to be pregnant, and the plot is about making sure she safely delivers the baby while trying to keep her out of harms way in a dangerous world. The overall premise sounds alright, but the driving chaotic pace of catastrophic events felt rather unnecessary and annoying. Additionally, the director seems to have a penchant for melodrama. The main character's wife dies, best friend dies, and eventually the main character himself dies. These events are crafted to happen in a very dramatic heart-pulling fashion, but overdone to the point of being pathetically mawkish. My best guess is that the chaos and melodrama were the director's best attempt to disguise the lack of any kind of substantive content. Overall this movie is a heaping pile of garbage, filled with consecutive chains of melodramatic cliches, a disorganized, anarchic plot line, and lack of any meaningful subject matter. 0/10.
