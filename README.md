## Zbobo :P

## Winter
1. Avengers, Infinity War - 7/10 Exactly the movie I expected. Was much more enjoyable watching on Netflix because I could skip through scenes that I found boring. Otherwise, this would be a 5/10
1. The Lobster - 8.5/10 Very interesting idea, dialogue was super unsettling. Great directing to make such a creepy tone. A surprisingly good movie.

### S tier - Best 10/10
1. When Harry Met Sally
1. The Fighter - A slow start
1. Cloud Atlas
1. About Time - This will certainly be a bold ranking. Movie is like a mix of When Harry Met Sally and Cloud Atlas for me. Just like Cloud Atlas, it's an ambitious film which gives you a feeling which is hard to describe.

### A tier - Really good 8-9/10
1. Silence of the Lambs
1. Children of Men
1. In Bruges - Feel like there were two reasons to make this film: to insult Belgium for 1.5 hours and (SPOILER) the scene where Ken is trying to kill Ray who is killing himself
