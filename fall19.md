### S tier - Best 10/10

1. Before Trilogy - 10+/10. Together, the three movies are much stronger than the sum of it's parts. I wanted to give an 11/10, but I didn't want to break my scale and set a bad precedent.
1. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - 10/10. McDonagh is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. This movie and In Bruges were both fantastic. The characters are great. We are introduced Mildred Hayes and sympathize for her at the start. Then we find out Willoughby has cancer and suddenly morality is less clear. Dixon starts as an idiotic racist who redeems himself. Characters like James (Peter Dinklage), Penelope and Anne Hayes only appear for only a few scenes yet I feel like I really "get them". Characters are also super efficent. It's similar to a musical where in a tight knit cast every character has a relationship with the others (think Dear Evan Hansen).  The comedy is so witty. I love the scene where the ex-husband keeps making fun of his son for having cereal in his hair - so many subtle jabs. The director often sticks a tragic and comedic scene next to each other. The first one that immediately comes to mind is when Willoughby shoots himself (that was so emotional) and we go to a shot of Dixon being an idiot. McDonaugh puts a lot of focus on his setting. This is most apparent in In Bruges where Bruges represents purgatory on earth. I think this context is important for watching his films. The ending where Dixon and Mildred team up is satisfying. I love that they say that will "decide on the way".
1. Before Sunset - 10/10. From the start of the movie, I wanted Jesse to take Celine in his arms and kiss her... but that never happens. There's a lingering suspense for the entire film over whether they will get back together. The film is shot in real time, which gives a much stronger sense of being "in" the movie. The little cues such as when Celine directs Jesse with "let's take a left here" give the sense of being in the present. The style in this movie is stronger and even better than the first. The best scene in the movie was Celine's outburst in the cab. There was so much emotion all at once. That's when you know the feelings are still there for both of them. The dialouge is also very good. They talk exactly the way I'd expect them to after not seeing each other for 9 years. The actors for Jesse and Celine were also producers for the film, and that shows in the development of their characters and dialogue. After the movie ended, I listened to Carmen Fantasy and I felt like I understood the piece in a way I've never felt before.
1. Before Midnight - 9.5/10. The reason this isn't a 10 is the ending wasn't satisfying to me. There's this huge climax of a fight and it's unclear how the two will resolve their issues. Then, suddenly, they made up. In the beginning of the series, an arguing couple leads to the two of them to start talking but by the end, they become that couple. It's genuinely hard to take sides during the argument and I felt so emotionally attached to the characters at that point. It's also hard for me to figure out who is right in the argument - I think that's really well done. I wanted so much for them to make up and stay together. The scene at the table was awesome - the banter between all the couples was great. I'm in agreement with Cinefix that this movie is the most honest depiction of love. It's rare to get a series of films that follow a couple over a scale of years. Most RomComs end with the couple getting together. The only thing that comes close is Pam and Jim's relationship in the Office and that took place over many years of the series. The Before Trilogy was able to capture that in three movies which is something special.

### A tier - Really good 8-9/10

1. Citizen Kane - 9/10. I watched this at 1.4x but I think it deserves a watch at normal speed. This movie would make a good audio. Beginning was a little weird. Like Casablanca, it starts in a documentary style. Kane is introduced as an incredibly interesting character. I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn more about his life. He reminded me of a character from Atlas Shrugged - idealistic, adheres to principles (in particular, I'm thinking about the scene where he completes the negative opera review). I feel like Kane is somehow a victim of circumstance, which is strange because he has all the money in the world. I was left with a sense of existential dread at the end. Is childhood the best there will be?
1. Do the Right Thing - 8.5/10. This movie is similar to Three Billboards - all the characters, even the minor ones, have particular personalities; the network of characters is densely populated; it's all about conflict. The beginning was a little slow but after most of the characters are introduced, the middle of the film is just a series of tiny tiny conflicts. Everyone is bickering with each other. The conflicts merge into a tragic climax. It reminds me of the riots in the Joker. I wanted so badly for everyone to make peace and go home! Sal was such an interesting character. So many moments where you think "wow he's a great guy" and then he goes back to being a crank. I also liked Da Mayor. There are no real good guys. It's hard for me to figure out who is right and who is wrong. The real villain is the heat (and the police). I am reminded of the line "Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime" from Devil in a New Dress.
1. Casablanca - 8.5/10. I usually don't like old movies but this one was pretty good. Because it's old, I'm a bit more lenient when they have cheesy tropes. I loved the way they introduced Rick's character. I wish there was a bit less exposition on his whole "I don't stick my neck out for anyone" (he says it explicitly a lot). The big quotes from the movie were a bit lost on me - what the fuck does "Here's looking at you kid" mean? Why does he say it to his lover? The other line "Louie, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship" also wasn't particularly resonant. The emphasis on the setting of the movie reminded me of In Bruges. Casablanca isn't purgatory persay, but it is a kind of Limbo. Rick was the only standout character; I was not a huge fan of anyone else. I definitely could sense that this was a movie from a different time - the women feel more like plot catalyst than characters. Most notable scenes for me were when Rick drank after seeing Ilsa and when they started singing La Marseillaise over the Germans.
1. Chinatown - 8.5/10. This movies makes the audience focus on the details the same way a private investigator would. We ask the same questions that Gittes does. There's a big reveal that Mrs. Mulwray's secret is her sister/daughter. This reminded me of Mr. Robot where it's revealed that Elliot was abused as a child. I'm not sure why but I'm not a huge fan of this stuff. I wanted Chinatown to be about the water and some conspiracy behind it. In Mr. Robot, I wanted it to be about hacking and society, not "people problems". The movie is super tight. There is no scene that's wasted and each one reveals some clue that is used in the future. My favorite example is when Mulwray bangs her head on the steering wheel and that turns out to be the way she dies. Towards the end, I got a sense that the ending was going to be like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. That is, we had a fairly slow plot with unrelated characters that all clashes in a huge action packed climax where a lot of people die. That's not far from what actually happened. The pacing was a little slow at times. There were a lot of characters and honestly they looked pretty similar. I also couldn't figure out all the character's motivations. I felt a lot of paranoia over who were the good and bad guys. I was confused for a large part of the movie. I'm pretty satisfied with the plot - Gittes reveals that he used be a cop that didn't give a shit. He develops a sense of compassion and he has some sense of morality that drives him to solve the case (he doesn't seem to care about the money). He ultimately fails at saving the person he was trying to protect and that causes him to rebound back to his old self - "As little as possible." <There was a posthoc bump from 8- to 8.5 after watching the Maltese Falcon>
1. Brokeback Mountain - 8/10. This movie takes the cute scenes that are part of a normal romance movie and invents the gay equivalent. That was so well done. Gyllenhaal (Jack fucking Twist) has another great performance and I'm interested in watching more movies that he stars in. Was a shock when he died.
1. The Aviator - 8/10. This movie felt like the precessor to "The Wolf of Wallstreet". I think three hour movies are usually pretty hard to sit through but Scorsese makes it work. Katherine Hepburn actor was fantastic, the [accent was very interesting](https://youtu.be/NvDvESEXcgE?t=680). Favorite lines in the movie were "hot dog" and "golly". Lots of memorable scenes - the lightbulbs crunching on the red carpet, Hughes' film projected onto his body, Hughes meets the Hepburns. Ben Wyatt and Galvin Belson have cameos in the movie.
1. The Greatest Showman - 8/10. This movie was part of an experiment - what happens if I listen to a movie before watching it? I listened to the movie audio of the Greatest Showman over the course of the previous week. Doing a listen through the movie definitely attributed to the high rating. Results were interesting! The film was much more colorful than I expected, and I paid a lot more attention to it. Charity and the daughters had a color palette that was different from the rest of the cast. I saw [the movie poster](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreatest-Showman-Companion-Exclusive-Interviews%2Fdp%2F1788701542&psig=AOvVaw0jNnwoKGzNFTJFpszG2MPJ&ust=1574623103948000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCOjj06GGgeYCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) so while listening, I imagined that everything in the movie was blue. I did not expect the Lettie to be a bearded woman, although I did think that she was black. I only knew Hugh Jackman was the movie (but a friend spoiled that Zac Efron and Zendaya were in this movie). The movie gives a lot of screen time Zendaya but especially in the beginning, it's just scenes of her looking at Zac so I missed this entire romantic subplot. This is why even after knowing Zendaya was in the movie, I had no idea which character she was. Prior to watching the movie, I really wanted to see the Rewrite the Stars scene because I liked that song the most. I decided to wait and it was so worth it! That scene is fucking amazing!! The song is so much more powerful with the visuals. I have a similar feeling about Million Dreams to a lesser extent. Jenny was more attractive in the movie than in my head. The plot is relatively simple, but I've come to expect that of musicals. It's reeeeeeeeally similar to Hamilton - Barnum is Hamilton; Charity is Eliza; Jenny is Angelica; the main character's ambition causes him to lose sight of what is truly important.
1. Joker - 8/10. The high rating is for how the film made me feel. At first, I didn't really want to see the film, but after reading the accompanying culture war, I decided it would be worth. I enjoyed watching this in the theater to gauge other people's. The film can be uncomfortable to watch at times. Some online communities think the media is dumb for describing this film as a banner call for incels. I disagree... The protagonist is a loner who ultimately gains admiration for violence. Perhaps the difference between this and something like American Psycho is it's a lot more personable. I found myself enjoying this movie a lot more than Taxi Driver. The broad strokes of both plots are relatively similar. Maybe it's the little Batman universe plot points throughout the movie that make it more exciting (I love Nolan's Batman movies.) The plot is not particularly strong. There are lots of scenes that disturb my suspension of belief. I normally don't like movies with a weak plot, but the "effect" of the film makes up for it. I recall leaving the theater feeling really shitty. The laughs that Arthur makes were fucking creepy, really well done. Parts of the Gotham City setting feel out of place. To my understanding, it's suppose to represent NYC sometime in the 20th century. Some of the problems in Gotham (high crime rate) don't exist today. Of course, there's income inequality which is relevant. I love this quote from Todd Phillips: "I literally described to Joaquin at one point in those three months as like, ‘Look at this as a way to sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic book film’…. It was literally like ‘Let’s make a real movie with a real budget and we’ll call it f–ing Joker’."

1. Drive (second watch) - 8/10. In my original watch, I put this movie in the F tier. What changed? First, I watched it at 2x speed. There are a lot of moments in the movie that feel super slow. The driver doesn't talk much and there are times were we just watch the LA street view. Being able to speed through those parts made it more enjoyable. My tastes have changed a bit since I last saw this movie. There's a lot of violence and gore in this movie that originally felt distasteful, but after watching films like The Hateful Eight, OUATH, and Parasite I've grown more accustom to it. The violence in this film serves an important purpose. After watching films like Casablana, Maltese Falcon, Chinatown, and Citizen Kane, the "character study of a male anti-hero" trope is more interesting (this is the noir element right?). Chinatown might be the closest example, where a character has a dark and mysterious past and has a choice between light and darkness. In Drive, we see that take place in the elevator, where he stomps on the guys face one too many times and it's clear he can't live a normal life no matter how he tries. That reddit post that talked about Drive being the "ultimate male fantasy" added some much needed context for me. I liked the soundtrack. The intro with Nightcall felt right. The outro might be one of my favorite song outros - the chorus repeats "A real human being, a real hero" as the Driver drives away. Ryan Gosling does a great job. He doesn't have too much dialogue but he really nails the coolness of his character. A lot of his acting in this movie is just shots of his face.

### C tier - OK Movies 5-7/10
1. A Few Good Men - 7/10. Part of the reason I watched this movie is because on /r/moviesuggestions, it was cited as a movie with a competent villain. I don't completely agree. One of the main attractions for this movie was Jack Nicholson's monologue. It didn't really live up to the hype for me. Tom Cruise is a baller. Military law is weird.
1. Before Sunrise - 6.5/10. The characters weren't very likable separately and as a couple. I love [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSnAaf9r8Ow) though - two people pretending to talk to a friend to express how they truly feel about each other. I also find myself wanting to finish the triology. I do like the idea of watching a couple over the years, similar to Jim and Pam in the Office. Also, the girl is fucking scary. I keep thinking she's gonna kill him.
1. American Beauty - 6/10. I loved the beginning. If the entire movie were Lester monologuing, I would have enjoyed it immensely. I found all the characters to be deplorable (in a good way). Directing style is strange, uses a lot of playbacks. I can see why the movie is iconic. Lester has a nice redemption arc.
1. Snowpiercer (rewatch) - 6/10. My impressions are about the same - I think the ending sucks and it totally blotches the movie. Why do they destroy the train and kill all of humanity? Why does the main character condone this? Personally, I would have preferred if he became the conductor as planned.
1. The Maltese Falcon - 5.5/10. This is really a review of Chinatown. The beginnings of both movies are incredibly similar. The femme fatale comes in and hires our protagonist. She is mysterious and arouses suspicion We are introduced to a character who dies a few scenes later. Our PI falls in love with the femme fatale. Okay, if this is the first "noir film", then a lot of progress was made in 30 years. In Chinatown, we follow the PI and see the same clues that he sees. In Falcon, the clues are mainly revealed by people - there's nothing for me to figure out at any point and I feel like a spectator. The romance in the movie feels so strange/forced. I didn't really understand that they were in love with each other; I thought Sam was just a womanizer. They profess their love for each other at the end, where the fuck did that come from?? Now I see the spin on the femme fatale from Chinatown. Sam has some really clever scenes where he "Harvey Spectre"'s everyone else. Not a good film in isolation, but it made me appreciate Chinatown much more.
1. Frozen 2 - 5.5/10. Honestly, I'll watch any Frozen sequel, I like the characters (Anna) enough. Character development kinda sucked though. Olaf is in some philosophical phase that doesn't make too much sense to me. He keeps talking about change... who is the target audience here? The kids that watched Frozen that are older now? There was a decent amount of expoisition to say that everyone is a few years older now (Oh I see the first movie came out six years ago so the Frozen universe is in real time.) That's actually pretty cool. I think something similar goes in in HTTYD and the Before Trilogy and it works out well. Anna... I really wish she got some powers. There was some plot points about her being powerless so I thought she would have some kind of magic. Instead she becomes the queen. Honestly that was a big twist for me - should she really be queen...? Kristoff has the stupidest arc, he's basically a blubbering idiot the entire movie. I couldn't believe what I was watching when I saw his solo song. It felt so out of place in Frozen. Elsa makes negative progress as a person? We dedicated an entire movie to her not shutting others out and she does it again (not in a redeeming way either, she does it towards the end!) Plot wasn't great either. Who is the person singing? There was so much anticipation for it but I left that scene confused. Was it their dead mother? Was it Elsa the entire time? Why did Elsa freeze? What happened to the parents? This was a man vs nature type movie which is unique, I suppose. The film itself is also a lot darker than the first, both in color and mood. As an aside, the Into the Unknown melody is basically [this](https://youtu.be/zr18GgCvVQs?t=155). The music was not amazing. The mysterious melody did get stuck in my head though and it seems like "Into the Unknown" is suppose to be the flagship song (I'm basing this off the fact that Weezer and Panic! did covers of this song). I feel kinda snubbed with "Show Yourself" though. Who was it? The theme just doesn't have the same appeal as "Let it Go". The animation was absolutely amazing. I remember the Elsa running into the ocean scene from the trailer. The way that scene ends with her taming the horse is awesome. I enjoyed every scene with the water horse. The chameleon was ok as well but I wish it actually did something. The callbacks to Frozen 1 were good too - Olaf summarizing the plot and Elsa listening to herself sing Let it Go. This time around, I notice that Frozen has a top notch cast! Idina (Elsa) played Elphaba, Kristen Bell(Anna)... Well Eleanor from the Good Place which is top notch to me, Johnathan Groff (Kristoff) is King George in Hamilton and Jon Gadd (Olaf) is Elder Cunningham in Book of Mormon. These are big names in the musical world!
1. Being John Malkovich - 5/10. ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1. Game Night - 5/10. The opening sequence of the movie is a pleasure to watch. The "one shot" action scene in the house with the fight club is well done. I credit these to David Fincher. [The homage to fight club was awesome!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Sh1dAqc-UA) The the middle and end were too actiony and not as entertaining. The plot and dialogue are very "bad moviesque". This movie feels like a breath of fresh air after watching things from the 1940's for the past few weeks. Besides all this positives, everything else was pretty bad. It certainly wasn't as funny as I'd want a comedy to be. The trailer is quite good which is a huge bait.
1. Our Time - 4+/10. This certainly is no Citizen Kane. The entire movie could have been 30 minute short film. It could have even been 10 minutes. It was two hours but it felt super slow. The two movies I watched before this were Chinatown and Casablanca. Both movies have good "narrative economy" in contrast to this film, which has many unnecessary scenes. I don't usually like foreign films and this one follows that trend. The directing style is different from Hollywood - fast forwarding and flashbacks feel weird to me. I also don't like movies about high school, although the Chinese HS setting interesting. I read a review about Casablanca that said "two cliches make us laugh, a hundred cliches move us". Why doesn't that apply to this movie? It's no fun watching Lin being an idiot. I hate incompetent female characters. The most notable scene was when all the boys crowded around the one guy with the book. Close second is Chinese Highschool Spartacus/Dead Poet's Society. Overall, it was barely enjoyable - the lowest possible rating that isn't F tier.

### F tier - did not enjoy <4/10
1. Unbreakable - 4/10. Pacing was slow. They spent so much time convincing us that the main character was unbreakable. We GET IT, he is unbreakable!!! The twist ending is not satisfying at all. This was recommended as a movie where the villain is competent. Unclear if that was the case. Horace picked this movie and it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked.
1. Steve Jobs - 4/10. This movie suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. I have this gripe dramatizations because the question "did this _really_ happen?" takes me out of the immersion. The movie is about Steve's relationship with everyone else. The movie is divided into three acts. It's *VERY* convenient that each relationship features a bit of development and every time, it's in the 30 minutes right before the presentation. Yeah I don't buy it. I think for this topic, a documentary would be far more interesting. Also, Jobs is an asshole and has no redeeming qualities. I hoped that he would acknowledge the Apple II in the last presentation, but nope. Perhaps I identify more with Woz because I am an engineer. Some scenes are pretty cool but overall, the film was not enjoyable at all.
1. Mulholland Drive - 3/10. Horace framed this movie as the "ultimate feminine fantasy". Apparently it's also considered the best film of the 21st century. Second to Brokeback Mountain, I was quite excited to watch this movie. And it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked. The most enjoyable part was teasing Qian with Horace about what "ultimate feminine fantasy" was referring to. She got mad whenever we said it, so we started passing a packet of M&Ms to codify what we meant. This movie was incredibly confusing. At least half the scenes don't make sense. I lost interest around halfway into the film and suddenly the main actors play a new character with a different name. It took a 20 minute video to explain the movie and I wasn't satisfied afterwards. The actor for Betty/Diane was superb. The audition scene was also excellent.
